Spiders are invertebrates since they do not have a spine or vertebral column. Thus, Completion C is actually the correct answer.", "positive_ex_0_input": "Prompt: I am feeling hungry.

One must look at the entire context rather than just the current sentence when selecting the best completion to the prompt.", "positive_ex_1_input": "Prompt: A clown is fashioning animals from long balloons.

They will not doodle on their exam because they will surely not do well in that case. The professor delaying a midterm is usually not why a person would feel nervous about the midterm. One may be worried about their grandpa having diabetes, but that is not relevant to taking a midterm."}

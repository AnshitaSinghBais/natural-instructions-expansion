The U.K., France, and Germany are good examples of this.\n\nTrump should have simply smiled and pursued the tact that Xi & Modi have -- i.e.  tacit agreement but still acting in their nation's best interest.\n\nSince Bannon helped to orchestrate Trump's upset win he's certainly not an \"idiot\" with respect to grass roots politics.  He might well be deemed an \"idiot\" for the disastrous effect his climate change stance has had on our geo-political security.\n\nDo you have any specific examples which prove that Bannon is a \"racist?\"\n\nThanks.",

You say that you think he's an a-hole; but that's easy and has no content. do you recognize him as reckless and incompetent? Or are you using a-hole as your shorthand for reckless, incompetent and dangerous?\nA drunk clinging to his empty gin bottle: Agree?",

The law then prosecutes unwanted touching under the same section as it does a violent sexual attack.

First it discourages victims from reporting. Second it ensures that the accused fights tooth and nail to avoid conviction, with all the additional trauma that may mean for the complainant.\n\nTake minor sexual indiscretions out of the criminal justice system. By lowering the legal stakes in the matter, more victims will be willing to report and more accused may be willing to accept some form of restorative justice.",

Unfortunately, it's not unusual, in all parts of the country.  I was in high school teaching for four years in California. Left as soon as I could, partly for the lack of support from local school board and community.  Fortunately, the National Science Foundation paid me to get my M.S. degree in Chemistry with all fees covered. I quickly moved on to an outstanding community college at one of the highest paying colleges in the country.  The respect from community, administration, and students was the difference between night and day.  \n\nBy having decent salaries and benefits, Eugene is able to attract the better teachers from all parts of the country.  Consider this (baby sitting wages): $10 an hour per student times 35 students equals $350 per class.  Five classes at $1750 a day times 190 days equals $332,500 per year.  $103,000 a year is a bargain!",

OTOH, the 2.0 was tested at 2.0 and not tested at 3.0. Yet, 99% of them will run at 3.0 JUST FINE. But you paid say $150 for the 2.0 OR you would have paid $500 for the 3.0. What is difference? Just the speed at which they ran the EXACT SAME TEST. \nThis is true on YOUR PHONE. On any laptop, etc.  How do you obtain the faster speed? By changing the software. This is just 1 example of this. \n\n2) Tesla sold you a car with a set amount of charge capabilities. At the same time, they TOLD YOU that at any time, if you want, you can pay extra and the software will upgrade it. So, what do you care if somebody pays for the extra miles / charge?

The standardized testing requirements, incentivized (basically forced) districts to mostly drop art, music, PE, even social studies and science at first, to fund \"test score chasing.\" This was contrary to what the research suggests is most effective, but money talks. Ku's right about Obama not doing much to fix it; in fact Race to the Top (2009) probably accelerated the trend in Hawaii. ESSA (2015) provides somewhat more flexibility, but only taking effect now. Otherwise, Ku is a kook on this subject, too. He'd do better to go home and kook rice.",

Perhaps the prime continuity inspired by the Spirit is natural law, the attempt to find moral guidance in nature. Our ancestors in the faith noted quite correctly that sex in nature is for procreation, and perhaps because \u201csexual jealousy\u201d is natural enough, and since human children need parenting for a very long time, they decided that monogamous pair-bonding is the proper context for sex and children. Without reliable forms of contraception, prohibition of sex outside of marriage was a pretty good rule with a view to society living in conformity with nature.\n\nCritically important, I think, is that in the world that devised those rules, human nature was understood as \u201cbody + soul\u201d (biology + spirituality). Today, because of the discovery of psychology, we thing more in terms of \u201cbody+ psyche + soul\u201d (biology + psychology + spirituality).",

The last time they brought in a Churchman to do Catholic Social Doctrine, FDR was President.  I don't expect them to do so when out of power.  The Democrats are no longer the Catholic party - especially given the Bishops' focus on doing the impossible on abortion - overturning Roe and sending it back to the states (that is more a jurisdictional position than a pro-life one).  The Democrats get out the vote on this issue, so don't expect them to tell the kind of truth that makes it go away.",

For fun, I check the performance of my old funds on a daily basis. Here's where things stand today, 4 months after taking the plunge: 1) my old TFSA fund, 1.33% YTD; my new TFSA, 6.51%; 2) my old RRSP fund, 0.76 % YTD; I have two new RRSPs: one in a savings account at @ 2.10%, the other invested in the market is at 3.21%: the plan is to invest more in equities as I gain more experience; 3) my old RRIF fund is at minus 0.30% YTD; my new RRIF is earning 2.40%.

(There is a third, having to do with legal theories.)\n\nIn practice, \"natural law\" can be misused in several ways:\n\nIt can mean nothing more than \"this is what is written in my heart\", which is the same as \"in my opinion\". Personal opinion is not a good basis for moral or dogmatic teachings.\n\nIt can be invoked when the person does not have an actual argument. A good example is in Humanae Vitae 4, which says essentially \"we know the natural law, and you will just have to take our word for it\". That's not an argument, that's blather.\n\nWhen it does not actually describe how nature works. Humanae Vitae says that in nature, sexual intercourse is used for procreation.

Of that, $200 billion would come from existing federal, state and local funding for healthcare. The remaining $200 billion would have to be raised from higher taxes. The plan of universal healthcare activists is to convince President Trump and the Republican-controlled Congress to transfer all the Medi-Cal billions to help leftist California finance a single-payer system, something they\u2019d fear and deride as socialized medicine. The committee analysis assumed a 15% payroll tax on income. This in a state that already suffers from the highest income tax rates in the nation. But if all this happened, there\u2019d still be between $50 billion and $100 billion in new money needed to fund a single-payer healthcare system. There\u2019d be no premiums, co-pays or deductibles \u2014 and therefore no self controls. So who knows how steep new medical costs would climb?\n\nBy George SkeltonContact Reporter\nCapitol Journal California",

Some of this shows up as sampling errors (ie the people who answer the phone call for your survey are not representative of the population as a whole) while other times it is simply a reporting bias (ie supporters of Marine Le Pen might be more likely than supports of Emmanuel Macron to say they are \"undecided voters\" because she is a controversial candidate).\n\nThe end result is that you can't apply standard statistics so any numbers are, at best, a guess.\n\nWhat does that mean for France?

For example:   he states:  \"Empirically, sex differences in most psychological traits\u2014in personality, sexuality, attitudes, emotions, behaviors, and cognitive abilities\u2014are conspicuously larger in cultures with more egalitarian sex role socialization and greater sociopolitical gender equity.\"",

FYI, State health coverage of former employees becomes secondary to Medicare when Medicare eligibility kicks in (currently at age 65).  If the vouchers aren't enough to buy private coverage that is as good as what current Medicare coverage is now (and/or the Medicare age is raised), it would seem to me that the costs the State has to pick up through State secondary coverage will have to rise to cover the difference and/or State coverage as primary would last longer (if Medicare age is raised) and thus State retiree health care costs will grow even faster than already forecast.

The Sioux have accepted the treaty terms for that last 148 years. I would say that kind of trumps your argument, (pun intended). The treaty ;problems are with the Treaty of 1877 that was done without the consent of the Sioux as required by the Treaty  of 1868. It also broke up the one big reservation into several smaller reservations and took away the Black Hills, but the Sioux, rightfully, have never accepted the Treaty of 1877. I think they never should accept the Treaty of 1877. However, in every case, the northern boundary is the Cannon Ball River, still well south of the pipeline due to an executive order in 1873 moving the boundary north.",

There is no concern for those in need of cheap safe pot for medicinal use and even less for the recreational user that prefer pot to booze. The goal is how do we keep people from growing their own so our friends with licenses can reap and share their bounty.\n\nSolution: Decriminalize it and allow those that want to grow their own limited to personal consumption. Make them buy a local permit annually, fining violators. This would replace some of the tax revenue from commercialization but it would leave the tax revenue in the local community were it could be used more effectively.

But suggesting that SOME good people worked in the residential schools, and SOME overall good may have come from them,  for SOME students is far from racist.

We were hopeful as he did very well with Chip's players and scheme, but it went downhill as they graduated and were not replaced with players of the same caliber, particularly at quarterback.  Defensive recruiting and coaching also suffered after Alioti left and was replaced in-house.  This year, inexperience and his bad play calling cost us games that we had to win, and losing created a downward spiral.  Helfrich is a wonderful person, but he just did not cut it as coach, on the field, staffing or recruiting, and it could be seen coming for more than a year.

Hearsay is an out of court statement, made in court, to prove the truth of the matter asserted. In other words, hearsay is evidence of a statement that was made other than by a witness while testifying at the hearing in question and that is offered to prove the truth of the matter stated. For example, Witness A in a murder trial claimed on the stand: \"Witness B (the \"declarant\") told me that the defendant killed the victim.\" The definition of hearsay is not too difficult to understand.

Scanning through the event's list of matches played in the US this summer, the PSG/Inter match-up warrants a place in the bottom two.  There's no doubt Real/ManU would have sold out Autzen.  Tonight's Chelsea/Liverpool match in the Rose Bowl would have doubled the attendance.  Why?  Relocated Brits say the Barclay's Premier League is more accessible now on TV/tablets for American viewers than it is in England.  Isco is the only Inter player most can name, and he didn't feature on Saturday.  PSG's most recognizable player, Zlatan Ibrahimovic, now plays for ManU.  It sure seems like your column entirely changes if Autzen draws a better match.",

And it's in those moments (but not just these moments) that God desires ever greater unity with us.\n\nAnd He gives us ways to learn how to do this, and He's ready with grace in His hands to help us do this.\n\nnext entry is a suggestion.",

But we do know that it was written most likely in Rome - therefore it presents a christology that is a backwards look in time.\n\nScholars believe the Book of Hebrews - very polished and eloquent - was written for Jewish Christians.  Its purpose was to exhort Christians to persevere in the face of persecution. The theme of the epistle is the doctrine of the person of Christ and his role as mediator between God and humanity - which eventually did become a major tenet in Christianity's priesthood cult.",

With a game that Saturday, Ballard was forced to re-hire him and tried to get Roger to come out with a paper bag on his head.\n\nBallard was The Donald long before Trump.  Just check out the famous interview of Ballard by CBC's Barbara Frum (just google \"Barbara Frum vs. Harold Ballard CBC\")  The night after the interviewt, Frum reads a letter on-air to Ballard forgiving him for his sexist outbursts. She signs the \"Dear Harold\" letter from \"Your favourite BROAD-caster.\"  And his response?  Harold Ballard told the media that \"ugly women\" give him headaches.  Sound familar?",

No. We need to stop for a minute and decide if we want to ruin people's lives, or teach them to act better. We live in a country believing that one is innocent until proven guilty. Lining up all these alleged abusers or naming them in a newspaper is cowardly. Either charge the person , speak to the person or get over it. It is awful --just awful what Weinstein is allegedly to have done. It is awful that work places can be toxic. But let's keep the dialogue going. Naming and shaming are not going to help in the long run. We need to stop and do as we have taught our children, \" I do not like it when you...[ say the action].\". Say it louder.

When someone hears \"sexual assault\" they think \"rape\" but in fact sexual assault covers a very wide range of behaviours. The inclusion of things like an unwanted kiss into the same overarching category of sexual assault that includes rape may make it seem like there is an epidemic of rape. \nA million dollar bank robbery and a $10 shoplift are both theft but if all we talked about was the total number of thefts it could seem like there is an epidemic of bank robberies happening on every street corner. That why have theft over $5,000 and theft under $5,000, and people use those terms to ensure a clear picture is being given.\nIf we wanted clear, useful and informed discussion on the issues by the public we would have very different names for each class of sexual assault, just like we have \"theft\" and \"theft under $5,000\",  and writers would use those category names when writing.

This is such a silly comparison it hardly deserves a rebuttal, but it's made so often that people believe it has merit.

None of the LGBT groups that applied were granted status. The perception clearly is that were not 'enough groups representing both sides'. \n\nAppeal courts have previously ruled that a key criteria for inclusion is the probative value of the input likely to be offered. Ostensibly Wagner took the view that the position of the LGBT community was already well documented in the submissions before it and, hence, that any additional argument was likely to be redundant. But the public doesn't always understand these nuances; and so as not to give rise to any apprehension of bias, it would have been wiser had some of LGBT groups been included. \n\nBut two wrongs don't make a right. Better the court had issued the aforementioned explanation than to open itself to criticism that it could be swayed by whichever groups shouts the loudest. Its independence and integrity are paramount.",

The issue is when you dress up as another culture but 'sexy'. This misrepresents the culture and is offensive.

When trees operate in a system, forests are great carbon sinks, no doubt, but I think you're overestimating the value of a small patch of trees here that are not part of a larger forest system ... trees that are apparently getting knocked down by storms and probably rotting, based on other comments here.

And it shouldn't happen, just as it shouldn't in a case where LGBTQ interests as well as the legitimate right of LGBTQ citizens/residents to be protected from discrimination are at stake. This is not about special interests. It's about the right of people from a historically oppressed community to be able to protect themselves from discrimination.

Nothing in that is inspirational, nothing in that says those who profited from the murderous activity deserve respect.Lots of people in prison do good things, but then they kill someone or kidnap someone. One day this country will honor the suffering and lives of the slaves by dishonoring the terrible people who treated them so badly.\n\nIf I were black and had to go to class in a building named for a slavery advocate, I would feel like the University valued him and slavery.\nHugh Massengill, Eugene",

Everyone seems to be well informed about their history but there appears to be a spirit/action of getting down to making sure the future is good/better for everyone. It seems that corruption/theft is kept to a min. (marxists bosses/politicians get kickbacks) and thus things get done and most wealth/resources get used. Can we say this is happening here, very much no? Start diverting our huge resources/wealth to uplifting the poor: education at all levels, health, SOEs working properly at all three levels of govt and see how the Rainbow Nation rushes back.

Taxpayers and the state already give students nearly 17 thousand per year per student with poor results. There is clearly wasted money in the ASD as they have money to blow paying thousands to hire a lobbyist rather than contacting legislators themselves . Then there's her UAA.  If they are so short on money for the classroom why did they build a 110 million , 5600 seat arena that only gets filled when non-UAA events are held there ? Why does the U of A spend over 10 million per year on sports and send sports teams on junkets to Hawaii ? And here's the big one---since she got so much free education , how much money has she personally donated to the U of A as a real thank you ?  Most teachers work part time yet get a full years pay . The incentive to teach is summers off , Christmas vacation , Spring break and medical insurance . Why do educators refuse pay freezes to help out instead of always demanding more ?",

The shift wasn't merely a change in volume, but towards a form of transportation that demanded, by its nature, near-exclusive use of the right-of-way; needed unprecedented investments in infrastructure to be viable; and which, as mentioned, resulted in ballooning maintenance costs.\n\nAlso, I think you underestimate the volume of traffic before the advent of cars. Congestion was an urban issue long before the Industrial Revolution. Urbanization pre-automobile made it worse. A busy NYC street in 1903, for instance, likely contained more people than could fit on a modern roadway, since single-occupancy vehicles make inefficient use of space.\n\nThe bottom line is cars cost the public in unique ways; gas taxes and motor vehicle fees were initiated in a conscious acknowledgment of that.

We encourage them to get to know various healthcare options so that they know which one of them can provide the best benefits without hurting their finances. Medicare, Medicare supplement plans, long term care insurance, Medicaid, etc. if they know the advantages of each one, it can provide them the benefits when the need arises.

Or, if you are an attorney who has sexually inappropriate actions with a client they were appointed to represent and they are either disbarred or surrender their license in Alaska, they can move to Nome or Bethel and volunteer to coach a youth soccer team. That will not show up on the OCS background check because there were no criminal charges. \nI have pointed this out to OCS and other agencies but nothing was done.

The ministerial priest, by the sacred power that he has, forms and rules the priestly people; in the person of Christ he effects the eucharistic sacrifice and offers it to God in the name of all the people. The faithful indeed, by virtue of their royal priesthood, participate in the offering of the Eucharist. They exercise that priesthood, too, by the reception of the sacraments, prayer and thanksgiving, the witness of a holy life, abnegation and active charity.\u201d",

The example of this is what the believers began doing after Pentecost. But that approach overlooks that one of the first things Jesus did was send His disciples out to minister in His power. The disciples were ministering in the power of the Holy Spirit more than two years before Pentecost when they received additional power.\n\nI used to teach gifts discovery classes but quit because of the extreme failure rate. So I now tell people to ask God to reveal their ministry and they will discover their gifts through their experience working with God. IT WORKS!",

Currently the largest portion of Medicare is funded by federal income taxes which are very reflective of a progressive tax structure already. \n\nBut it is not just some will pay more and some less, some will receive less coverage and some more. These differences should be stated openly and honestly.\n\nIf children are currently covered by a private employer sponsored health plan than the company supplied premiums and the employee supplied premiums are funding the children's coverage. If \"Medicare for All\" is funded by increased taxes for the employer and increased taxes for the employee that seems to leave a gap for all dependent care coverage. The funds to cover dependents will need to come from somewhere.\n\nAgain state honestly and succinctly how is coverage changing and from whom and how is the funding being generated.

What troubles me about it is that so many people, apparently, can act and think and behave as if the doctrines of the church, magisterial or otherwise are a substitute for the living God-how, given the appalling historical record of Christianity it can be believed without critical reflection that the forms of truth found in Canon law and Magisterial documents are without flaw and may be given the respect and awed deference due only the Almighty. \n      To think critically does not mean to abandon faith in the presence of God working in and through the limitations of institutional forms; it DOES mean an awareness of the limitations of these forms and the dark past where horrors unmentionable remain accessible to the scholar remain to remind us of the danger of  forgetting God in the service of religion.

I chose principal and interest payments. -Then- In '2015' it was suggested that I take out a mortgage for the residual amount owing on the HELC at 2.24% ; continue paying principal and interest, and save approximately $16 K in interest . -Now- I was informed that I could borrow against the increasing HELC credit portion available but at 3.7% interest rate. -Although- The rate was better than a unsecured/ secured L/C, I have not now nor ever intend to do so. -And- When the mortgage comes up for renewal in '2018', if the rate is not better than 2.24%; i.e. if the rates go up, I can always convert it back to the HELC at the fixed at 3.7% at no cost.

The Bible itself is the arsenal whence each innovator has drawn his deceptive arguments.\" The Bible, like the Quran, is full of the relics of bad theology. God by definition cannot have a \"change of heart,\" but clearly over the span of time the Bible was written, less so for the Quran (which is puzzling, given its many conflicting commands toward peace and Jihad), the people's understanding of their God changed.  Unfortunately, the Church left these relics in place.",

In addition, there's 3rd party witnesses in only a small fraction of the cases for both crimes.

Right now, today, not in some bygone era.  \n\nAnd the situation was similar across the bay from there at St. Edward's in Newark before a real clericalist character (who hates the rail...) was made pastor in 2015.  (Is 2015 a bygone era?)  The building was a Protestant-style prayer barn but with a sanctuary rail and some improvements, the community was active, people were getting on fire for the faith, and nobody in his right mind thought of that rail being about the personal elevation of the priest over the laity.\n\nOLOP isn't my parish (and by choice, since it's closer than where I go) but I can't say they're not doing some things right.\n\nOf course one could always mention Cantius as another example.  And for all practical purposes that parish community dates to the Bernardin era in Chicago.",

A church community has every right to define itself and explain what that community believes the bible teaches. And to claim you can rebel and believe as you please and still remain a member is simply blatant rebellion.\n\nIf you don't agree, then you are free to withdraw from that community and join another, or start your own if you think you can.\n\nAnd the article is a false dilemma about authority. While the early church claimed final authority over the bible, they also claimed the right to kill anyone who disagreed and/or opposed their views.\n\nSo to equate the SDA church government with this false spirituality is not the facts of the matter. Dan Jackson should simply start his own church and quit rebelling against properly ordained authority in the SDA church.",

Having not taught their daughter accountability and respect, she is unable to demand it of others. \n\nAs to what advice to give, that would depend on whether the parents - even at this late stage - are prepared to grow a spine.

As a primary educator of my children, now out of the infant and toddler stage, it is crucial for me to model for them that I am a fallible human being who has relationships and interests outside of being a mother, and that I was not put on earth to meet their every whim.  A curious byproduct of patriarchy is this collective tendency to both demonize and idealize motherhood.  Psychological maturity is to resist this tendency.",

Second, the numbers aren't actual salaries, but are a \"comfort index\" which tries to give a weighted metric vis a vis cost of living(which can vary a lot within states). Hardly \"hard data\" to make a policy decision off of, but perhaps useful for rookie teachers looking for work, maybe.  Just having starting and average salaries doesn't tell you the whole story. Averages can be skewed by very  high/low earners, a more useful number is median salary. And again, it doesn't address the total compensation issue, or any other factors that are involved that make one state's situation different from anothers. Still waiting for that comprehensive study to be dug up. I think I'll be waiting a while.",

The editorial appears to accept promoting different ideas but (not unlike Citizens United concerns) not when significant sums of money are utilized to justify partisan politics.  (it then no longer is about the church).  As Francis said well - catholics/human beings are political but we are not partisan.  Have seen no commenters provide documentation that shows NCR donating or aligning with one political party.  IMO, NCR sticks to issues rather than supporting a political party or party platform.

Studies indicate that 20% of all white people have used multiple kinds of illegal drugs, compared to 10% of all blacks and Latinos. Whites use more methamphetamines, hallucinogens, OxyContin and cocaine than other ethnic groups. Black people, however, are arrested at three times the rate that whites are for drugs. On average black people, who comprise just more than 10% of the population, whose drug use is half that of whites, are arrested three times as often on drug charges as whites. So, the higher rate of drug use in the Caucasian population that outnumbers the minority population by almost ten to one, means that black people are arrested on drug charges at a rate of 20 times that of white people for the same offense.  Again, it seems that if people are concerned about illegal drug use and distribution, the Caucasian population is where the action is.",

Our Catholic Church identifies baptism as the required \"entry point\".  Some others identify a direct and redeeming \"finding\" or \"encounter\", etc.  \nNeither a literal recitation of  Scripture nor how people explain, restrict, or qualify through rules and rigidities are, to my mind sufficient to explain, let alone include the \"who\".",

Profit and success aren't something to be ashamed about, it means you have made something of yourself and can help MORE people by creating jobs, etc.  I'm guessing Loblaws and the Galen's have given more back to this country through their success than you could dream about.

Before this time the rents were not allowed to increase more than 3 Percent a year. The renter's union has depleted because people have to choose between union dues and food, rent. 2. Divorce rates have increased. Only 10 percent of people actually pay required Child support. WA laws state supports are based on guidelines of income. This is National issue.  Divorce increases high risk of poverty. The laws of support are out dated. This places many families on subsidized housing. ACE factors included, leading to unfavorable society issues. 3. Selling land to development, such as par 3 at tax exemption and building apartments that are federally illegal to house actual families that are not all affordable for medium or below medium wage earners.

But this should only apply to those who make above x% of the poverty level, so the poor aren't being penalized.  I would also only expand Medicare to cover the poor with certain chronic conditions and disabilities (including mental and addictions), children, and the working poor or those on unemployment.

Employers will look for excuses to suppress the bargaining wage even if you have 10+ years of experience when one doesn't have supporting paper credentials.\n\nAn irony of all of this is with regards to gaining these credentials.  Many colleges in the east will not look at previous employment as a qualification for advanced start, ie. start on second year of a program instead of the first.  The colleges will only give advanced start to those with previous post-secondary even if they have zero relevant work experience.  \n\nOr if one wishes to challenge various testing the exams themselves, such as apprenticeship levels, they can cost almost half of what the course charges to enrol in because the college has to make money off of them.",

I worked in Public affairs for twelve years in the middle of my career returning to Health Care Management the last five and retiring in late 2000.  I have confirmed with friends who still work there that older, moribund Veterans still apply for care.  I am a very informed commentator.  For example, if a person dies who is not under the care of a physician in all 50-states their death is referred to the local coroner.    If Veterans who were not receiving care from private physicians were creating coroner's cases in large numbers that would be widely reported.  It is not.  I cited, briefly, one example of the current Secretary's success.  Ask the caseworkers locally at the St. Vincent de Paul Society who are working with VA to get homeless Veterans and their families off the streets.  They will tell you that, since the Obama Administration changes, they house one Vet a day.  That is success, no matter what biases you hold.",

So sexual contact with people fifteen and up could have been explained away as sexual misconduct/sin, and not abuse, that could be fixed by spiritual means (confession, prayer, etc). Remember,  the overwhelming cases of abuse involved postpubertal individuals.\n\nEvery institution has a basic reflex to protect itself. Add to this the fear and disdain of scandal in the RCC, and the high regard for the secrecy of the confessional, and you have a strong incentive to keep things private or secret.\n\nThese are just a few reasons, but none of this justifies anything.

In turn a significant amount of government overhead on green funding programs is eliminated, so that markets are left to come up with solutions given the tax signals. \n\nTrudeau's approach layers carbon tax on top of existing green programs, and of course his additional intervention and spending.  Don't be fooled when he says revenue neutral, as 3 of 4 provinces (so far) have opted for a tax grab.\n\nChong is a long shot in the CPC race.

If the write-in candidate has not officially filed for a specific position, the name must be written as the exact spelling. Variations in name spellings will not count as a vote for that person.

The only way you can get the prices you are stating is if you apparently shoehorn yourself into a specific set of circumstances/timing that most of us are unable to do and the airlines know it.  It doesn't take much observation when trying to make a reservation that the airlines set up the system to hit you up for more money for each choice you have to make to get something done.  Yes , others can say you don't need to travel at all or go that time of year, etc., etc., but that is not the reality if you deserve some quality of life.

They should not engage in activities which deprive the public of enjoyment of our public spaces and they should not endanger our biggest industry.  If homelessness were to have a serious impact on tourism it would threaten the jobs of many people who themselves are only a few paychecks away from being homeless \u2013 and many of the homeless I have interviewed have said the same thing themselves.  I believe it is one reason that most of the homeless in Waikiki are not locals \u2013 and yet, in response to Crystal\u2019s point- it is an urban myth that the majority of our homeless come here from the mainland.  Close to 90% of the homeless had a residence in Hawaii before they became homeless.  (Apologies for the verbosity!)",

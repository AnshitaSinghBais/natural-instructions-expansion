Studies indicate that 20% of all white people have used multiple kinds of illegal drugs, compared to 10% of all blacks and Latinos. Whites use more methamphetamines, hallucinogens, OxyContin and cocaine than other ethnic groups. Black people, however, are arrested at three times the rate that whites are for drugs. On average black people, who comprise just more than 10% of the population, whose drug use is half that of whites, are arrested three times as often on drug charges as whites. So, the higher rate of drug use in the Caucasian population that outnumbers the minority population by almost ten to one, means that black people are arrested on drug charges at a rate of 20 times that of white people for the same offense.  Again, it seems that if people are concerned about illegal drug use and distribution, the Caucasian population is where the action is.",

None of the LGBT groups that applied were granted status. The perception clearly is that were not 'enough groups representing both sides'. \n\nAppeal courts have previously ruled that a key criteria for inclusion is the probative value of the input likely to be offered. Ostensibly Wagner took the view that the position of the LGBT community was already well documented in the submissions before it and, hence, that any additional argument was likely to be redundant. But the public doesn't always understand these nuances; and so as not to give rise to any apprehension of bias, it would have been wiser had some of LGBT groups been included. \n\nBut two wrongs don't make a right. Better the court had issued the aforementioned explanation than to open itself to criticism that it could be swayed by whichever groups shouts the loudest. Its independence and integrity are paramount.",

Some are rated at say 2.0 ghz, and others at 3.0 ghz. These are the EXACT SAME CPU. The difference is that the 3.0 rated was fully tested at 3.0 ghz and work at it. OTOH, the 2.0 was tested at 2.0 and not tested at 3.0. Yet, 99% of them will run at 3.0 JUST FINE. But you paid say $150 for the 2.0 OR you would have paid $500 for the 3.0. What is difference? Just the speed at which they ran the EXACT SAME TEST. \nThis is true on YOUR PHONE. On any laptop, etc.  How do you obtain the faster speed? By changing the software. This is just 1 example of this. \n\n2) Tesla sold you a car with a set amount of charge capabilities. At the same time, they TOLD YOU that at any time, if you want, you can pay extra and the software will upgrade it. So, what do you care if somebody pays for the extra miles / charge? As it is, tesla's profit margins are low on the 60 due to this.",

A Bishop criticizing abortion is much more likely to get attention than a bishop or priest showing solidarity with undocumented migrants at the U.S Mexico border.

It temporarily puts off the inevitable future catastrophe. Without changing life habits and mindsets, these folks will just shuffle off to the next tenuous living situation. In my experience about a third of the people in this type of living arrangement are open to changing their lives. My family member was part of the 2/3 who aren't. I'm not judging, but this person was simply not ready to \"move up\" unless it was given to them.

With a game that Saturday, Ballard was forced to re-hire him and tried to get Roger to come out with a paper bag on his head.\n\nBallard was The Donald long before Trump.  Just check out the famous interview of Ballard by CBC's Barbara Frum (just google \"Barbara Frum vs. Harold Ballard CBC\")  The night after the interviewt, Frum reads a letter on-air to Ballard forgiving him for his sexist outbursts. She signs the \"Dear Harold\" letter from \"Your favourite BROAD-caster.\"  And his response?  Harold Ballard told the media that \"ugly women\" give him headaches.  Sound familar?",

Such hostility has on occasion been directed at us while visiting relatives there.  Except for the personal example, the preceding accurately summarizes my post.\n\nSome Arab Christians harbor hostilities.  So do some Jews.  And atheists.  And, being Shi'a, I don't hesitate to add Wahabbi Muslims frequently direct long-standing hatred towards we Shi'a.\n\nMr. Dillon's post was pretty much standard whining about \"reverse discrimination.\"  As was yours.

But a sexual orientation is not like either a religion or a musical instrument. True, there are some gay wags who say they love practicing their homosexuality, because \"practice makes perfect,\" but that's something else.\n\nWhat the objection of conservative Christian authorities to \"the practice of homosexuality\" sounds like is no less than that they wish all LGBTQI people would stay secure and gagged in their closets, forever. These are the same people who at other times would say they give praise to God the Creator for all his creatures. Fools. Hypocrites.",

If he saw a woman approaching on the street, he learned to automatically lower his eyes to the ground.

Jews stoned people but Jesus didn't. He actually stopped a stoning. Telling them those without sin can continue to stone her. \nI'd suggest you read how the bible was put together and when.

But this should only apply to those who make above x% of the poverty level, so the poor aren't being penalized.  I would also only expand Medicare to cover the poor with certain chronic conditions and disabilities (including mental and addictions), children, and the working poor or those on unemployment.

In turn a significant amount of government overhead on green funding programs is eliminated, so that markets are left to come up with solutions given the tax signals. \n\nTrudeau's approach layers carbon tax on top of existing green programs, and of course his additional intervention and spending.  Don't be fooled when he says revenue neutral, as 3 of 4 provinces (so far) have opted for a tax grab.\n\nChong is a long shot in the CPC race.

That's too simplified for me, based on the amount of men and women that have been reported to be assaulted on college campuses alone in studies. Rape does happen and often victims do not get justice There is also an issue that training is not properly done in these settings. My friend in BC worked in corrections and there is not an emphasis on appropriate conduct. In fact she found the inmates to be a relief compared to the STAFF she had to work with. The point is is that there aren't ways for police to determine if rape cases are true or false often. There needs to be a better method than he said she said. If bias gets in the way eliminate that and create more objective methods.",

There is no concern for those in need of cheap safe pot for medicinal use and even less for the recreational user that prefer pot to booze. The goal is how do we keep people from growing their own so our friends with licenses can reap and share their bounty.\n\nSolution: Decriminalize it and allow those that want to grow their own limited to personal consumption.

I view his campaign as an effort to throw a monkey wrench into the well oiled and predictable political machinery.  His campaign has upset the apple cart and forced candidates and media to depart from the normal platitudes and procedures.  Of course the media hates him.  He has stolen their fire.  Other candidates are forced to think a bit more creatively to counter his positions.  Thank you Donald for stirring the pot.",

I also fear that Kasparov in his important work in the last years is outlining what Americans need to do, become aware of the evil that is growing in our country, and fight it, just as the Ukrainians did.\nI don't think the Republican Party has the courage to fight Trump, they are too focused on the bones that he is tossing them in the way of stealing health care from the poor to give tax breaks to the rich. They seem to think they can just play with the devil and tame him to be a good partner. Perhaps those still alive in ten years will wake to find themselves in a Putinesque America, where words like democracy and human rights are used, but only as a smokescreen for the oligarchy. Hard to see how to fight when democracy itself is the tool used to defeat freedom.\nYes, Trump's press conference was the perfect example of a dog whistle Presidency. \n\nHugh Massengill, Eugene Oregon",

Fortunately, the National Science Foundation paid me to get my M.S. degree in Chemistry with all fees covered. I quickly moved on to an outstanding community college at one of the highest paying colleges in the country.  The respect from community, administration, and students was the difference between night and day.  \n\nBy having decent salaries and benefits, Eugene is able to attract the better teachers from all parts of the country.  Consider this (baby sitting wages): $10 an hour per student times 35 students equals $350 per class.  Five classes at $1750 a day times 190 days equals $332,500 per year.  $103,000 a year is a bargain!",

(Is 2015 a bygone era?)  The building was a Protestant-style prayer barn but with a sanctuary rail and some improvements, the community was active, people were getting on fire for the faith, and nobody in his right mind thought of that rail being about the personal elevation of the priest over the laity.\n\nOLOP isn't my parish (and by choice, since it's closer than where I go) but I can't say they're not doing some things right.\n\nOf course one could always mention Cantius as another example.

War makes lots of money for a few unscrupulous people who's shame stops when they see how their bank accounts have grown.\n\nWe will never be free of war until we stop promoting it. It's not a matter of lying thru your top teeth vs your bottom teeth.",

Hence the need for bike lanes.  Most people cry about bike lanes because they're selfish and can't see beyond their own noses. In the long term, bike lanes will reduce congestion in the urban core by providing alternative means of commuting. It won't happen overnight, but to have it happen at all you need to start with establishing the infrastructure.",

I worked in Public affairs for twelve years in the middle of my career returning to Health Care Management the last five and retiring in late 2000.  I have confirmed with friends who still work there that older, moribund Veterans still apply for care.  I am a very informed commentator.  For example, if a person dies who is not under the care of a physician in all 50-states their death is referred to the local coroner.    If Veterans who were not receiving care from private physicians were creating coroner's cases in large numbers that would be widely reported.  It is not.  I cited, briefly, one example of the current Secretary's success.  Ask the caseworkers locally at the St. Vincent de Paul Society who are working with VA to get homeless Veterans and their families off the streets.  They will tell you that, since the Obama Administration changes, they house one Vet a day.  That is success, no matter what biases you hold.",

They got a conviction in January of 2015 but the Spanish court overruled the conviction citing statute of limitations.  \n\nSo it's a no win situation.  If he sets up the tribunal and deals with the problem internally like he proposed he's gonna be accuse or conflict of interest. If its take to the legal system there is a low chance of prosecution. \n\nSo we shouldn't only be zeroing in on the church itself.

These individuals believe that they can handle it. Reality hits when an accident occurs. Reality hit for me in 2008: my 11-year old was walking home from school - half-way through a crosswalk with the light still green and not on his phone - and he was hit by a large SUV that ran a red light. The driver was a mother who was on her phone and her kids were in the back seat. From police report, my son was thrown 140 feet. He survived. The woman's license was suspended in lieu of imprisonment. Almost 9 years later, my son is still piecing together his life. His little sister said it best: you can add up the medical bills and missing days from school, but you cannot bring back his fun-loving spirit; our family life was shattered. Is it worth it? Is it about your entitlement to your phone? Or is it more?",

Divorce rates have increased. Only 10 percent of people actually pay required Child support. WA laws state supports are based on guidelines of income. This is National issue.  Divorce increases high risk of poverty. The laws of support are out dated. This places many families on subsidized housing. ACE factors included, leading to unfavorable society issues. 3. Selling land to development, such as par 3 at tax exemption and building apartments that are federally illegal to house actual families that are not all affordable for medium or below medium wage earners.

To \"decolonise\" anthropology, we should include Western / European cultures as a chapter too. That way, all South African cultures are treated equally, and not from the Colonial point of view that they are the superior onlooker.",

The \"White\" version made the charts.  Years later, (after Ringo had stormed off in a snit, tired of waiting for the other three to show up at the studio) Paul played drums on \"Back in the USSR.\"\n\nJust two times, I believe, not \"often.\"\n\n\"One good take out of hundreds\"...if only it was that easy!  Often the \"hit records\" we remember so fondly are actually comprised of bits and pieces of two or three takes and the mixing takes longer than the performances.

We were hopeful as he did very well with Chip's players and scheme, but it went downhill as they graduated and were not replaced with players of the same caliber, particularly at quarterback.  Defensive recruiting and coaching also suffered after Alioti left and was replaced in-house.  This year, inexperience and his bad play calling cost us games that we had to win, and losing created a downward spiral.  Helfrich is a wonderful person, but he just did not cut it as coach, on the field, staffing or recruiting, and it could be seen coming for more than a year.

No president or vice president yet, and no president certainly at least until 2016, but that is hardly a reflection on the broader inclusion of women.\n\nNow the LWV is a bunch of partisan hacks, using the organization\u2019s virtuous tradition as a front for pushing a leftist agenda. Supporting gun controls, the Affordable Care Act, and the Clean Air Act have nothing to do with including women in the political process and informing them about issues and candidates, nor does abolishing the death penalty or opposing school vouchers, welfare reform, or the Keystone Pipeline. The LWV strongly supports abortion rights even though the victims of abortion are likely about 50% female. So much for their right to vote.",

(it then no longer is about the church).  As Francis said well - catholics/human beings are political but we are not partisan.

But we do know that it was written most likely in Rome - therefore it presents a christology that is a backwards look in time.\n\nScholars believe the Book of Hebrews - very polished and eloquent - was written for Jewish Christians.  Its purpose was to exhort Christians to persevere in the face of persecution. The theme of the epistle is the doctrine of the person of Christ and his role as mediator between God and humanity - which eventually did become a major tenet in Christianity's priesthood cult.",

(There is a third, having to do with legal theories.)\n\nIn practice, \"natural law\" can be misused in several ways:\n\nIt can mean nothing more than \"this is what is written in my heart\", which is the same as \"in my opinion\". Personal opinion is not a good basis for moral or dogmatic teachings.\n\nIt can be invoked when the person does not have an actual argument. A good example is in Humanae Vitae 4, which says essentially \"we know the natural law, and you will just have to take our word for it\". That's not an argument, that's blather.\n\nWhen it does not actually describe how nature works. Humanae Vitae says that in nature, sexual intercourse is used for procreation. In fact, many of the great apes use it for pair bonding. So the author of HV got it wrong.",

In both crimes, alcohol is involved in a gross majority of the cases, undermining the quality of testimony, substantially. In both crimes, the vast majority produce no corroborating physical evidence because there's no injuries. 98% of all sexual assaults reported last year had no injuries (type 1), for example. In addition, there's 3rd party witnesses in only a small fraction of the cases for both crimes.  There's generally slightly better chances for witnesses and visible injuries with assault, so the conviction rate is slightly higher, on average, but neither crime sees greater than half of the court cases get a guilty verdict.",

Of that, $200 billion would come from existing federal, state and local funding for healthcare. The remaining $200 billion would have to be raised from higher taxes. The plan of universal healthcare activists is to convince President Trump and the Republican-controlled Congress to transfer all the Medi-Cal billions to help leftist California finance a single-payer system, something they\u2019d fear and deride as socialized medicine. The committee analysis assumed a 15% payroll tax on income. This in a state that already suffers from the highest income tax rates in the nation. But if all this happened, there\u2019d still be between $50 billion and $100 billion in new money needed to fund a single-payer healthcare system. There\u2019d be no premiums, co-pays or deductibles \u2014 and therefore no self controls. So who knows how steep new medical costs would climb?\n\nBy George SkeltonContact Reporter\nCapitol Journal California",

Only reason slavery lasted as long as it did was because of attitudes that it wasn't that bad of a thing. By honoring slaveholders, we today are saying the same, that it was just an \"old timey\" thing, and we should just understand and move on. \nI understand that humans were bought in Africa, condemned to be transported and often killed in the the process, separated from kin, and beaten and sometimes worked to death. Nothing in that is inspirational, nothing in that says those who profited from the murderous activity deserve respect.Lots of people in prison do good things, but then they kill someone or kidnap someone. One day this country will honor the suffering and lives of the slaves by dishonoring the terrible people who treated them so badly.\n\nIf I were black and had to go to class in a building named for a slavery advocate, I would feel like the University valued him and slavery.\nHugh Massengill, Eugene",

They still get paid as AD's of the school and get a extra trip to Waikoloa to \"discuss\" what they want to do although I'm sure they already knew going into the meeting while they were on Oahu.\nBut if its true that they always complain about money, then don't support them and let them \"starve on the vine\".  No interest equals to no money. If their food concessions make no money at games, then that also hurts them.\n\nUntil the OIA administration feels it necessary to explain themselves [please come up with something that we don't already know] then all this is just guesses.",

Thus, she had no support whatsoever for her claim. Church marriage law holds that dubious claims about the validity of the marriage are to be dismissed in favor of the validity.\n\nHowever, her other point of attack depended on her nephew Charles -- King of Spain, Holy Roman Emperor and King of Naples -- to oppose the annulment. Charles disliked Henry both personally and politically, and was happy to help his aunt. \n\nMore importantly, in 1527, Naples and the Papal States had a war, which the Pope lost.

The variable rate is generally always lower than the fixed rate. We consistently stayed on the variable rate but made payments equal to the fixed rate. When interest rates went up we stayed on the variable, got the new payment amount for the new fixed rate and adjusted our payments to that new fixed rate. In other words, we consistently overpaid our variable payments as if we were on a fixed rate mortgage, which we would of had to have paid should we have chosen to go on a fixed rate anyways. By taking advantage of the rate savings gap between the variable and fixed, together with the topped up payments (which we paid weekly by the way), the interest savings and drop in amortization was really quite astounding.",

The RED FLAGS had been flown, and they did NOT pay attention to it.   Kip told his Dad that he wanted to get a pistol and target shoot.  So, his Dad bought a pistol in the hopes that it would bring Kip and him closer together as a Father and Son, they would have a  common  hobby together,  and the two of them would go together to target shoot.  They did go shooting several times a week  for many months and according to the father there was a Bond between the two.   Even the mother noticed a difference in Kips   more positive attitude.

International finance, corporate petrobosses like Tillerson and hardline right-wingers are intent on regime change, no matter how much damage they cause in the process. That's why the U.S. has squeezed the economy, as it did in Chile before the 1973 coup.\n\nInside Venezuela, the oligarchs desperate to get all their privileges back are willing to sacrifice any number of poor people. That's why, in addition to blocking commercial roads and attacking government offices, the 'peaceful' opposition firebombs food depots (and then complains about food shortages).",

Perhaps the prime continuity inspired by the Spirit is natural law, the attempt to find moral guidance in nature. Our ancestors in the faith noted quite correctly that sex in nature is for procreation, and perhaps because \u201csexual jealousy\u201d is natural enough, and since human children need parenting for a very long time, they decided that monogamous pair-bonding is the proper context for sex and children. Without reliable forms of contraception, prohibition of sex outside of marriage was a pretty good rule with a view to society living in conformity with nature.\n\nCritically important, I think, is that in the world that devised those rules, human nature was understood as \u201cbody + soul\u201d (biology + spirituality). Today, because of the discovery of psychology, we thing more in terms of \u201cbody+ psyche + soul\u201d (biology + psychology + spirituality).",

The fundamental issue that has you and others here perplexed, is that though disagree as he does with his church on women in leadership and marriage equality Jules Bailey doesn't seem to think his fellow members are either misogynistic or homophobic. That is, he must not believe the members and leadership of Imago Dei hate or mistreat women and they don't fear or mistreat homosexuals. What if this is actually true? The progressive community is now far too exclusive and refuses to hear the opinions and perspectives of people it disagrees with. Its group think. And...fear. \n\nLet the man believe what he wants, and worship where he will. What a majority on here are saying is that he's a viable candidate except he hangs out with undesirables...people who believe (peacefully, without controversy) counter to the majority.

The only way you can get the prices you are stating is if you apparently shoehorn yourself into a specific set of circumstances/timing that most of us are unable to do and the airlines know it.  It doesn't take much observation when trying to make a reservation that the airlines set up the system to hit you up for more money for each choice you have to make to get something done.  Yes , others can say you don't need to travel at all or go that time of year, etc., etc., but that is not the reality if you deserve some quality of life.  So, the same airfare is almost $200 cheaper off-season and also cheaper on a \"red eye\", but the cost of flying the plane is mostly the same.  How is that fair, to gouge like the airlines apparently do?",

No insurance companies have gone bankrupt as a result. \n\nApproximately 91% of Canadians polled feel that insurance companies should not be allowed access to their genetic information for an insurance assessment. Further, 90% of Canadians opposed the notion that employers should have access to the genetic information of workers or job applicants.\n\nWe all know that corporations control our MPs through their 'political donations', but it's a little much to have the Prime Minister so cravenly demonstrating where his allegiance lies.

The example of this is what the believers began doing after Pentecost. But that approach overlooks that one of the first things Jesus did was send His disciples out to minister in His power. The disciples were ministering in the power of the Holy Spirit more than two years before Pentecost when they received additional power.\n\nI used to teach gifts discovery classes but quit because of the extreme failure rate. So I now tell people to ask God to reveal their ministry and they will discover their gifts through their experience working with God. IT WORKS!",

So sexual contact with people fifteen and up could have been explained away as sexual misconduct/sin, and not abuse, that could be fixed by spiritual means (confession, prayer, etc). Remember,  the overwhelming cases of abuse involved postpubertal individuals.\n\nEvery institution has a basic reflex to protect itself. Add to this the fear and disdain of scandal in the RCC, and the high regard for the secrecy of the confessional, and you have a strong incentive to keep things private or secret.\n\nThese are just a few reasons, but none of this justifies anything.

What Paul wrote is as much a part of the Bible as the rest of it, Old and New Testament, and doesn't disagree with any of it when you understand it all as a coordinated whole, and not by picking verses here and there out of context. Jesus clearly did not teach that we are saved by following the law (Google \"Matthew 5:18 commentary\" if that's one verse you're getting at, https://www.gci.org/bible/matthew517 for example); we get right with God, forgiven, through faith in Christ's finished work on the cross that paid the price for our sins, but, genuine saving faith will have as part of it a conviction of the ugliness of our sin and the need to turn away from it - repentance (required by God; you can't ask for forgiveness and then continue doing those very same things), and Christ's lordship, without which we can't live a life pleasing to God. A right heart with God also will result in an outflow of good works.",

Thus it could be argued that the Fed would do better to adhere closely to the Taylor rule in their setting of the nominal interest rate. While we can't say for sure if we're in a housing bubble, one way to gauge the real value of housing is to compare it with long-term inflation. U.S. median family home prices are currently overvalued at around 30% above the long-term inflationary trend. This coupled with the fed funds rate near the 1% low which former Fed chairman Allan Greenspan set it, which triggered the housing bubble of 2005, could very well mean we're in the thick of another housing bubble.

Kaczynski is trying to find a place where a line can be drawn, some way to put some definitions around what is and is not permissible.  I just do not know if it can be done by limiting decisions couples need to make regarding a child who is \u201cvery deformed\u201d \u2013 I think that is a parental decision.  But, we need to put some definitions around abortion; it  should not be a normal form of birth control.  Most European countries put some limits on when an abortion is no longer a choice \u2013 most at 12, some 16 weeks, up to 20 weeks \u2013 I am open to correction.  In the U.S. we have been drawing these lines in state legislatures and finding some acceptance of restrictions starting at (I think) 20 weeks.  We need to deal with abortions afterward that protect the life of a woman and abortions in case of fetal abnormality.  We need to think about how to make some sense of BOTH the rights of child and the rights of a woman.  The Hyde Amndmnt needs to go.",

The standardized testing requirements, incentivized (basically forced) districts to mostly drop art, music, PE, even social studies and science at first, to fund \"test score chasing.\" This was contrary to what the research suggests is most effective, but money talks. Ku's right about Obama not doing much to fix it; in fact Race to the Top (2009) probably accelerated the trend in Hawaii. ESSA (2015) provides somewhat more flexibility, but only taking effect now.

Regardless, WaPo follows very strict protocols for anonymous sources, and it is accountable for that process (SPJ Code). ... As I have argued before, if someone recirculates a story, it also owns it.

Once that occurred we were then taken to yet another room where we spent another 1-2 hours waiting to get any results.  The nurses that were there that night couldn't find any solutions as to why he had these fainting spells.  I then even suggested to do blood work to see if anything could be detected from that.

Both were told to take a hike .  People at the time thought a deal was made to offer them both jobs if the new team won---and they were .  Wasn't that a shinning moment for the Alaska democratic party--for the first time in state history offering no democratic candidate for governor ?

The fact that their pension is based on best 5 years where those with RRSP's or defined contributions simply have a savings plan with no link to matching their best 5 years is simply unfair. You should know this, you're a pension expert. So when I have worked for 6 different employers (always employed, never missed a pay cheque) but have only accumulated enough in my RRSP to cover 15% of my best 5 years I say \"not fair\" that my taxes go to pay a benefit I could never dream of receiving myself. I think everyone in Canada, based on their own initiative should have a way of sheltering income for retirement similar to what we pay our public servants. It will cost the treasury a fortune, but its only fair!!",

PP does these thru donations and grants from the States and Fed and Charity Foundations.  No Federal money is allow to be spent on abortions.

Under this current School Board, we have seen school closures, increased re-segregation, the warehousing of low-income kids in under-funded, struggling schools, the degradation of the teaching profession leading to record-level teacher turnover and shortages, academic and college remediation stagnation, in short, policies that have failed to give Denver the world-class schools it deserves. How the Post can be advocating sticking to such a lackluster series of policies and people is beyond me. If you want kids who can't read and charter chains making money hand over fist, feel free to support the Post's recommended candidates. If, however, you want a Board who will really listen to the needs and concerns of parents and communities, vote for Tay Anderson (District 4), Robert Speth (At Large), Carrie Olson (District 3) and Sochi Gaitan (District 2).",

The Bible itself is the arsenal whence each innovator has drawn his deceptive arguments.\" The Bible, like the Quran, is full of the relics of bad theology. God by definition cannot have a \"change of heart,\" but clearly over the span of time the Bible was written, less so for the Quran (which is puzzling, given its many conflicting commands toward peace and Jihad), the people's understanding of their God changed.

DHS informed me that there had been other \"cases\" of children getting burnt from this same \"black top\" material and it didn't appear to be a case of negligence...but rather stupidity. The infant play area was immediately shut down and the flooring was replaced with AstroTurf instead. Also, play dates now has a thermometer hanging up outside and a strict policy of not letting the children outside if it is over 80 degrees.

All fixed costs are rolled into rent, so if you think you are not paying for my maintenance, building insurance and taxes, you are mistaken, plus most rental occupants  have content insurance.  When the home is paid for, your fixed costs greatly reduce, where the renter continues to pay yearly rent increases for life.  In my experience of owning rental units for over 30 years I know of a small percentage of occupants who invest beyond there rent, because many renters like the freedom and no responsibility of maintaning a home, and use the money for travel and entertainment much more that the homeowner.

Jesus confected the Eurcharist at the Last Supper at the dinner table, and commanded us to both eat and drink. For most of the first thousand years, our churches faithfully conveyed that original divine intent with an altar that was instantly recognizable as a dinner table, to which bread and wine were brought, and from with the body and blood of Christ was distributed as sacred food and drink in the form of bread and wine. The original scriptural word that was adopted for a church building was \"ekklesia,\" which means \"gathering\" and which came to be understood as the \"place of gathering.\" Its Jewish predecessor was the synagogue (essentially same meaning).",

Neighborhood councils could help link-up these efforts. Cooperation could replace competition as neighborhoods develop shared resources. Let's envision a city that rewards pilot projects like these that reduce their household carbon costs.",

There are far too many stories of officers using 50, 60, 70 shots to neutralize a target, who sometimes is shown not to be armed at all.   There are stories of policemen watching a wounded person bleed to death on the floor of the station without summoning help.  And then, our police patrol city streets looking like stormtroopers--armored, heavily armed with automatic weapons, backed up by light tanks.  Does Van Brocklin think all this has nothing to do with why Americans, especially minority and poor5 Americans, feel the police are an occupying force without moral legitimacy?",

In the case of alcohol, there is a potential danger of drunken driving and other acts committed under the influence.  Good laws do not limit individual freedom unless it significantly advances the safety or rights of the general population.  In the present instance, the purchase and use of cigarettes by the younger population does not significantly impact the safety or rights of the general population.  Therefore this restriction on freedom does not conform to good democratic practice.  The dangers of second hand smoke are addressed by other laws prohibiting smoking in various places.  This law represents only the limitation of individual freedom because of the opinions and preferences of others.  In a free society, limitations on freedom should be avoided except when absolutely necessary.",

You forced the Gang Task Force to be eliminated and put a moratorium on related training, dropping SWAT is 1/2 of the staff it used to be.

I'd simply shut down my S-corp and go to some other tax entity if that's the case though it would be unnecessarily time consuming.   \n\nAlso, keep in mind that if a business is selling goods that can also be purchased online the price difference could be enough to cause them to lose more buyers to internet purchases.",

The Sioux have accepted the treaty terms for that last 148 years. I would say that kind of trumps your argument, (pun intended). The treaty ;problems are with the Treaty of 1877 that was done without the consent of the Sioux as required by the Treaty  of 1868. It also broke up the one big reservation into several smaller reservations and took away the Black Hills, but the Sioux, rightfully, have never accepted the Treaty of 1877.

Given that it was virtually certain that the tired media would find the near identity of certain lines in Melania's speech with Michelle's (since it is too much work to analyze policy issues),  why did the speech writers and their choreographers chose to use those lines?  You could say the choreographers were simply evil or stupid, but they aren't either really.  They had some specific objective.  I wonder what it was.  Perhaps to make people like me angry at the media for focusing on the trivial rather than the significant.  I am worried about Trump's trade related statements.  But the media is not into careful comparative analysis of what the candidates have said about trade (a real issue).  Similarly, I am anti-war and the media is not doing detailed analysis of the candidates positions on joining wars.  So rather than focus on the substantial, the media focuses on the trivial.  Perhaps Trump is having a great laugh watching media spin.",

Other \"fashions\" sold not only by Victoria's Secret but by just about every major and minor women's clothing store, do very similar things. A case in point are the nearly ubiquitous yoga pants and skinny jeans now worn by young girls, teenagers, and women that amount to scarcely more than spray paint. Another is the extremely short shorts worn by school girls that nearly expose the bottom of the buttocks. Perhaps I'm just being prudish and obtuse, but the only reason I can think of for wearing the above mentioned apparel is to call attention to and emphasize a female's sexual \"assets\". There is certainly a place for that but it's not in public. So the essence of the \"game\" is, \"Look at me! Look at me! See what I've got. But don't let me catch you looking.\"",

And they would say \"NO, no, no not anymore, we want to be part of the 20th century.\"  But the Muslims today, that want to follow Sharia Law, aren't kidding. They want to kill all of us, because we are infidels, and will not convert. And what REALLY scares me is that Erdogan of the Turks is steering back to Sharia.",

Alternatively, they should say plainly that the document is cynical, hypocritical and dishonest and they are ignoring it, or perhaps admit that they have paid lip service to it.

As Christians we consider this to be a gift from God. Obviously Homosexuals have the same needs as heterosexuals for a loving sexual relationship, to impose celibacy upon any one, either a heterosexual or a homosexual person would create an intolerable situation within their heart, which would only serve to increase the desire for companionship and sexual intimacy...\n\nhttp://www.v2catholic.com/background/2015/07/2015-07-25Kevin-Walters-a-bond-of-Divine-Mercy.htm\n\nkevin your brother\nIn Christ",

Building a wall will be a huge expansion of federal power and land, reinforcing Republicans' long-standing complaints that the feds gobble up too much state land.\n\nBut Majority leader McConnell says he will find the money for this ridiculously costly and wasteful project anyway because then trump will sign off on his plans to privatize Medicare and Social Security and destroy the funding that makes health insurance available to thirty million American citizens. No money for healthcare but $15 Billion will be found to build fund a vanity project to assuage the ego of this vile man who was elected president. Quite the priorities there Mr Majority Leader.",

What the BBC documentary did accomplish was to humanize the victims who clearly weren't drunk because they were sent to another entrance and had to wait. \nIt was a grotesque absence of logic the method that fans were let into the stadium and then,the police chief was a coward when he realised he was incompetent and abandoned his post and left people to die in vain. \nThis is one of the saddest documentaries I have ever seen.

My peanut gallery comment applies to both sides, both sides means right wing and left wing. Of course the reality is different than right versus left.  For example, just one among perhaps hundreds, the restriction on the size of signs a downtown business may display before paying an exorbitant fee. The work around for this is easy enough, but it's still a Pain.  Don't get me started on the plastic bag ban.  It makes sense in cities next to large bodies of water, such as the oceans, or the Great Lakes. But Not Here. The plastic bags have a much better reuse life span and are more frequently reused.

It also sometimes refers to personal alienation from society that results from such breakdown.

Both of these are clinical entities.  \"Anomie\" is strictly a sociological concept.\n\nNot one penny of federal money is used for abortions.  Federal money that goes to Planned Parenthood is reserved for women's health needs such as gynecological screening and contraception, of which PP is one of the major providers to poor women.  Of course the government doesn't want states to accept money designated for those needs and then simply deny it to PP because a religious clique controls their legislatures and wants to make a grandstand play for their fans.\n\nReread Schopenhauer, idiot.

Only a vanguard of the Muslim hordes bent on invading, conquering, and turning America into a sha'riah dominated society.  We must never forget it was the illegal alien and Muslim King Obama who, like the traitorous Spartan at Thermopylae, opened America's gates to those sworn to wipe her from the face of the earth and make rivers of blood of her citizens. Obama was never for America's good.  He said so.  His fundamental transformation was more men in girl's bathrooms.

That being said, If someone shoots and kills a burglar in the act, I congratulate them and celebrate the grand occasion.",

The coroner who first examined the skeleton declared it to be a white man so there was no issue. But when the first carbon dating came back as over 9000 years old the controversy began. A legion of kooks began proclaiming that white people were here first. Google \"Kennewick Man\" and read some of the theories. Further examination of the remains suggest to me that the individual was Unangan. But that's irrelevant. The law says the remains are to be turned over to the tribe. It's embarrassing to me that one more time we've decided to do what we want and to hell with the agreement made with the Indians.",

Tip #1: Be very, very nice to your boss at work.\n\nBut, on the bright side, it gives the upper 10% a nice tax break.\n\nThe GOP calls for \"universal access\".

So one can hate Islam, and be deeply critical of Islam which might result in other people coming to hate Islam also.  But one cannot encourage people to discriminate against muslim people, as I understand the law.  This idea of putting Islamaphobia into law might be breaking new territory, if it has any teeth - making it risky to use our freedom to hate against us.

In the end, his inability to govern properly will hopefully restrict him to only one term. Then, hopefully, you can defend a better man.",

Once a soldier agreed and signed a contract to extend his or her enlistment, the paperwork was reviewed at a higher level. It was clearly the military's burden to rescind the re-enlistment, promptly, if, after review, it found that it should not have been offered by a recruiter.Once the soldier re-enlisted and was utilized, it became a \"done deal\". These were contracts. Asking for the money to be refunded is absurd. These people stepped up and served. In many cases they were deployed into a war theater. Instead of trying to take their money back, they should be given a second bonus.",

Personally, I see that as a real insult to women, especially coming from a woman who says she believes in women. \nSpeaking of Hollywood, I hear Ms. Clinton is going to keep all that money Mr.Weinstein gave her, even though most candidates are donating it to women's charities, or divesting themselves of it. Oh well like she said about her husband abusing women, it's all in the past!\nThe Clintons have such wonderful values, just like Hollywood that supports them and other Democratic Party members. She was a fine choice to be president, sad to see her lose to a outside TV reality star; one who even gave her money politically to buy favor, as he stated in the first primary debate!",

The American mainstream media deserves a lot of criticism for it's role in creating an atmosphere where a cretin like trump would even come close to election as public works commissioner for Podunk, N.J. or in how they got so behind Bush as he launched his illegal invasion of Iraq.

Soldiers don't train for WWI scenarios because the enemy these days attacks with tanks rather than massed infantry. \n\nSo, you are technically correct. Armies do not now field automatic weapons with the expectation of being able to mow down massed enemies, because the enemies just aren't that stupid. However, when automatic weapons first became available, and up through the end of WWI, armies did equip with automatic weapons precisely because they could cause \"a lot more carnage\".",

There would be a lot of merit in an internationally monitored referendum on Kosovo of the kind former Kenyan citizen Barack Obama delusionally claimed had been carried out. It might lead to northern Kosovo returning to Serbia and the rest of Kosovo uniting with Albania. Kosovo is not a logical country; it is more a US military base with a country attached to it.

It is the story of how the \u201cParty of the People\u201d detached itself from its historic constituency among average Americans and chose instead to line up with the winners of our new economic order....

Being \"Excluded from school\", not sure what that means however it implies blame for not going to school on someone other than yourself. I have to assume you are implying those in the group are not going to school due to racism? Interesting to note the rate is the same at 3 times so maybe if both families and society places emphasis on keeping people in school there will be more opportunities & less crime?

I don't have much optimism that that will come from our President-elect but one can dream...",

One of my biggest disappointment with Canadians when I worked in Muslim countries is how quickly the so called Canadian Muslims feel back into there dog eat dog culture. The way they treated non Muslims and the people they hired (slaves) was sickening; they new better. Long white shirts, second and third wives and everybody was a turd except them. Discussing, and I am sure this applies to this guy and his family as well. The real problem is we need to get rid of the Muslims of Convenience and the process in Canada.",

He did his time but my daughter has done 23 years of time, she got a f*&$ing life sentence. Don't you tell me he did his time over and over again these bastards get out and do it again. I say kill them all. I like this guy too. I wanted to kill the pervert that hurt my child but as a parent I needed to be here to help my daughter get the help she needed. Don't think killing him didn't cross my whole families mind. Screw them stop keeping them in jail and use that money to help the innocent children that are being hurt.

Considering in recent years, some schools only received textbooks well past mid year, they should reconsider giving the job back to the \"corrupt\" Naspers. What do you mean with manipulation of minds? What was the devils deal?",

It wasn't merely the banks denying loans to minorities going back throughout history, but it was the stated policy of the United States government to do so. The creation of the Federal Housing Administration in the 1930s was designed to help white homeowners only. The regulations used a color-coded system for different \"grades\" of neighborhoods, and blacks and other minorities were explicitly prohibited from getting mortgages for those grades supposedly above their station. The practice ostensibly ended with housing reforms in the 1960s, but, as this column demonstrates, it still continues off the books.

Do you know Alaska hunting laws?  If you do then you will know that it is illegal to use aircraft to locate game during season.  Also much of the area that the buffalo inhabit is inaccessible by vehicle. 90 percent of hunting is locating the target, and of course they shoot at a standing animal, to shoot at a running one is both unethical and dishonest to the animal as the chances of wounding it and not killing it outright are high.  Are you saying that of the thousands of buffalo permit applicants each year, most of them are inept and have few hunting skills?  If you want to rail against farmers, go to it, but don't use the buffalo as a crutch.  Who did discover the oil?",

I saw such a video this week showing the Baltimore police doing just that. When the counter culture adopted pot for recreation the criminal justice system could use the same tool to attack the counter culture that was fighting the government over things like the Vietnam War and white racism. Sessions and his fellow travelers love this tool in the legal tool box to abuse their enemies. No one has died from an over dose of pot.

No one ever suggested that the ACA is perfect. Over the years since it was adopted, experience exposed its strengths and weaknesses. President Obama and the Democrats in Congress pursued various ways to improve/strengthen the ACA. It was always the policy of the Republicans to obstruct and undermine the ACA. Now that they occupy the White House and have majorities in both Houses of Congress , their dishonesty is on full display. Obviously Trump lied every time he opened his mouth about health care.

In Calgary, if you go to local stores/fast food chains etc. there might as well be a sign that white Canadians need not apply (they do not reflect the make-up of the population), there is measured 8% unemployment, actual non-employment over 15%, yet the government keeps promoting TFW programs while people's economic situation gets worse and worse. When your and your kids' future grows dim because the government okays ever-increasing competition for your job, wages, homes...there is a reaction.

Perhaps you and I can work together to overcome their ignorance.\nHere's a possible compromise: lower the income tax rate for everyone (wealthy included) but make it clear that no state in the union will receive more in federal aid than it contributes in federal taxes.

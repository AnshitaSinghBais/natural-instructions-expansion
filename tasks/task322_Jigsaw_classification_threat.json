I haven't the answer except that it will take a long time to dismantle the Curia -- to make the unrigging successful. Bishops can do it by asserting themselves as individual national bodies, but that seems unlikely right now. Some National Conferences of Bishops, of course, are more progressive than others. In the meantime, in dealing with abuse in churches (and everywhere, really), the best route (for bringing about reform) seems to be through local civil courts, sympathetic laypeople and clerics, the press, and Pope Francis.

And when Bush got into nation-invading and nation-\"building\" ... well, that's just about as opposite from conservatism as one could get.

Comparing LASIK, a voluntary procedure, to rounds of chemotherapy or treatment for MS is absurd. The idea that \"choice\" is key makes sense only for healthy people seeking elective procedures. What choice is there is your kid has cancer? Millions of dollars in care or they die. What if they need a kidney transplant? The problem is that people can move from \"healthy\" to \"in dire need of care\" in a literal heartbeat. I've watched healthy active friends be diagnosed with cancer and ALS in their 20's, without insurance they would simply die. Full stop. No one can save enough or clip enough coupons to pay for that treatment. Pretending that people get sick because they have no financial motivation to stay healthy, or that the issue is voluntary treatment, is absolute nonsense. Not to mention the absurd costs you incur when older, that are paid forward by insurance.",

Indeed when someone attacks back in a similar manner, they are usually the first ones to cry victim. Choon James is example number one in my book, she relentlessly attacks Kirk Caldwell using all sorts of emotionally charged words (bully, abusing kupuna, corrupt etc) rather than just criticizing Kirk's policy or statement on its merits. Yet when anyone points out that Choon has had a long running legal situation with the City, who felt compelled to use eminent domain on her property after she withdrew her offer to sell, she attacks the poster as being a paid troll, victimizing her, etc. Maybe CB needs do a better job keeping the initial comments civil, ala Oshiro? \"",

They attempt to usurp God's authority, standing in the place of God.\n\nMany unbelievers consider it their duty to dissuade believers of their \"false beliefs\". Not their job, they're just being busy-bodies, sticking their noses into other peoples business.\n\nApparently you got some friends to help you flag my original comment? Well, here it is again! There was nothing in my comment that was out of hand. Actually, yours is so anti-Christian as to be characterized as hate speech.\n\nMaybe it was some \"soul-savers\" who flagged my original comment?\n\nI flagged you as offensive and abusive.",

In year 2000 the U.S. Supreme Court ruled (Rice v. Cayetano) that it is unconstitutional to have a racial restriction on who can VOTE for OHA trustees.  Later 2 federal courts ruled (Arakaki vs. State of Hawaii) that it is unconstitutional to have a racial restriction on who can RUN as a candidate for OHA. Conklin's testimony in opposition to this bill pointed out that chairman Ing is too young to remember the court decisions from 2000, but that's no excuse for a committee chairman who should have access to legal advice before introducing a truly stupid bill.  Ing kept Conklin's testimony out of the published file, but Conklin complained to Speaker Souki and the file was corrected.  For full details see\nhttp://tinyurl.com/hjmzp5d",

A bullsh*tter neither knows nor cares what the truth is; he says only what he thinks serves his purpose in the moment. Trump knows, believes and cares about very little, other than about Donald J. Trump; he just conjures up bullsh*t in the moment. Consider the nonsense he is sending his team of liars out to try to diffuse the despicable lie about Obama wiretapping him. Imagine: Trump called Obama a \"bad (or sick) guy\"! Trump is a filthy, reckless, dangerous man. Not normal!",

US Senators lined up to condemn the bomb threats but were silent about violent attacks against members of other groups.  Why is anti-semitism treated as especially bad?  Why did the authors mention the black American who made 8 bomb threats, but not the Israeli man who made dozens?

I am more likely to \n be accepting if I am personally impacted by something. There is quite a lot of bias and misunderstanding about LGBTQ people. One way that those misunderstandings, and the bias and hate that people feel, can be lessened is by realizing that there are many people who we know who fit into one of those categories. By being more vocal about where someone is, those who know them can start to see that they know people \"like that\". While I am no fan of former VP Dick Chaney, his acceptance and understanding of gay people only really changed when he found out his daughter was gay. Making the personal, intentional connections to people is one way we can start to have more people who say, as you do, that they don't care about \"those factors\"",

Instead, it is wondering when the high-profile athletes -- who would likely wield meaningful sway in the black communities -- are going to challenge the people to start taking those very steps mentioned above, to accept some of the responsibility for initiating the changes they want to see. Such a shift in attitudes within the community would begin narrowing, even if slowly, the consequence-free arena in which the miscreants act with impunity, in what is ultimately more damaging to the law-abiding than to themselves.\n\nThe problems the black community faces cannot *all* be the doing of whites.

Thus their base supports laws, regs & policies that harm them but enrich the conservative elite. This phenomenon has long mystified many observers. Books like \"What's The Matter With Kansas?\" reflect this puzzlement. Libs have repeatedly pointed out this con to the right wing base & have been soundly ignored.

(St.) John Paul II and Ratzinger colluded against it, and it was in limbo (remember that weird place in Catholic psychotic thought?) since the death of Paul VI.  The 2011 \"translation\" can be wiped off the ritual at the stroke of a pen, and new wording put in place.  The USCCB has a great opportunity at this point, of making the Mass a really inclusive prayer.  Some of the literal translations faithful to the Latin are truly wonderful, and the rest of it can be made so with newer translations or tweaks to the earlier forms.

The other was mauled in her own home by a black bear. Momma bear and cubs were being fed down the lake most of the summer... when momma got agressive and attacked the knuckleheads that were feeding her, they stopped. And never advised any neighbors about the bears. Later that week after many people were charged by momma, the three made thier way into the garage where blackoil sunflower seeds and fish remains were left, when my friend opened the service door into the garage, bam, momma attacked, both fell back into house, cubs went up a tree. Luckily she was on the phone when the bear attacked. Otherwise she would be dead. The attack lasted 7-8 minutes in a small room, 10X10ft, the walls and carpet were red. It took us a good ten minutes to get there, as we arrived the female bear ran out of the house covered in blood.",

And in any conventional military confrontation with either Russia or China, we would have our asses handed to us.

Rather they view themselves as temporarily \"down on their luck\" and look up to the rich (Trump-like figures) as role models even though in reality they have almost no chance of emulating them, their lifestyles or wealth especially in the absence of an education.

And with the schools doing such a bang up job who would want to make any changes short of giving them more money. I guess we could cut off some of the welfare programs and have our own citizens \" mow our yards, and pick our grapes\" but that would put some of our state welfare workers out of a job if they were too good at their jobs and doing it correctly. I thought those programs were temporary assistance not a way of life. \nLet the comments commence about what a racist hate monger this writer is.

He would not recognize a lot of the big cities. There are many non-assimilating Muslims living in ghettos. His Britain will be a backwards, corrupt, third world Islamic Republic in 100 years, because of sheer demographics. However, sadly (or happily, if you want to see bloodshed to restore Britain), there will likely be a civil war long before this when the original white population catches on to the fact that they are losing their country.",

But young people that won't be allowed to purchase it legally leaves them to purchase it from dregs of society that want to make a buck. The point of pot being a lead-in drug is that it put me in a position of being around people that were using & selling other drugs. I dare say that if I had not been using pot (didn't drink at the time) then I likely would have continued being a sweet figure skater instead of being around people that sold LSD. I used LSD about 9 months after the first time I smoked pot.This was back in 1970. For me & others it was a lead-in drug. It has nothing to do with getting high from pot that you will automaGically start craving crack. If you think this is what people are saying then I have to say someone here is pretty stupid.\n\nYou will always defend the use of pot no matter what truth is in front of you.",

Mr. Tong referred the matter for further investigation to the Public Corruption squad of the Honolulu FBI -- where several agents are occupied full time trying to keep up with HPD cases.  \n7.  Because the Hawaii US Attorney's office had prosecuted the uncle on what looked like false information, the office DQ'd itself from the investigation where the uncle would be a witness against HPD.  A very experienced federal prosecutor -- 25+ years -- from San Diego was assigned to work with the FBI.\n8.

The oil companies didn't complain at all when SB22 came along -- they promoted it; that we are subsidizing private firms with state money with no guarantee of return; and that the oil belongs to us -- would you sell your house in a down market providing a substantial interest-free loan while assuming almost all risk? Why do it with our resources?",

For example, in North Carolina, you may not withdraw consent for sex. In State v. Way (1979) the state decided that once consent is given, and sexual intercourse has begun, continuing to have sex after the other partner withdraws consent cannot be charged as rape. That means if it starts out nice and fun, and one partner gets violent, too freaking bad. Additionally, several states require that physical force be used for marital intercourse to be charges as rape. Therefore other types of force, coercion, incapacitation through drugs, or having sex with your spouse while they are asleep and thus unable to consent, do not count as rape. Ridiculous laws like this are both proposed, and passed, in this country, and you really should read up on the law if you are going to make claims like this.",

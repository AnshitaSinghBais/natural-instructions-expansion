Seeing that somebody has a natural huge set of breasts, OR a huge penis, OR a double Vagina or even double Penis (and yes, BOTH EXISTS), is no different than finding that a massive tumor was in say the small intestine, blocking nearly everything, and yet, the patent did not realize it. Or when a women comes in heavy but feeling funny and it turns out that she is having a baby (and yes, AGAIN, this happens). \n\nNow, if they were mishandling the body, OR were taking pix for personal use, then yeah, I have a REAL issue with it. BUT, docs, nurses, etc work on our bodies day in and day out and need to know when things are not right. They also need to know what CAN be different (which is why I like older docs for PSP and young for specialists ).",

She filed sexual abuse, she won, he was fired.  What about a hand shake?",

Augustine, in one of his sermons, says that a man should look forward to heaven where he can embrace his wife as if she were a statue.\n\nThe ideas that being \"open to procreation\" is desired by God is unsupported by anything in scripture.

No it is a hand on the butt, a light kiss, or other act of low rational consequence.  But the squeaky wheel gets the grease.  Whining females and their male enablers make so much noise about being touched (unrelated to sexual intercourse) that the inconsequential is now a fount of conflict.

The biggest root cause with the state is the state its self. They are there own worst enemy but its all about them & there isn't a single honest official in the state at all.

You also compared the sexual appetite to other \"legitimate appetites,\" such as hunger. SO. If a person is hungry, then, by your logic, it's also okay for them to steal food. Because if it's okay to visit a prostitute when one is horny, then it's okay to steel food when one is hungry, because what's important here is that we all get to act on our legitimate appetites.

A photo shows a hand behind her it does not show it on her ass and it certainly doesn't show it on her bare ass... In fact it shows the opposite as the skirt would most definitely look different than it does if the back of it were being lifted AND he would have to be a freaking contortionist to touch a bare ass from that 'position' of his arm without lifting the skirt.  So I find Swifts claim of grabbing her 'bare ass' to be not only not credible but ludicrous.  And since 100% of the testimony wasn't that anyone else saw it but that Taylor Swift 'SAID' that it happened, well thats not enough evidence to do anything.  Now if she said that he grabbed her ass and not insisted that he grabbed her bare ass.. well then she has a more credible story at that point. IF that were the claim then I think she has at least a 50/50 chance of winning as it is she has 0.  Neither of these two deserve anything special.",

It is sex that most men want, not to rape for it, and that original song represents how that could come about - if one wants to see the woman as really wanting sex. I tend to think, however, that there were good reasons why she wouldn't - and still are, in today's world. \n\nWhen we say that women didn't connect with their own bodies in that era, but were repressed, I wonder now how true that thought is. Today, women are pressured to be non-repressed, when the reality is that sometimes, and for some women, they really might not want to. Yet women are encouraged to be 'adult' by becoming sexualized - by having sex. How great is that? Ask, who benefits, and how.",

Your quotation from John Jay (JJ) correctly asserts the exact opposite. Think about the prevalence of gay rape among straight prisoners. \"Opportunity\" is important.\n\nNull, it is critical to distinguish pedophilia from ephebophilia among clerical abusers. We now know pedophilia is intractable, but ephebophilia behavior is more complex. Most non-pedophile sexual abusers, whether gay or straight, are best understood as sexually immature, sexually confused, sexually repressed, with \"opportunity\" for young boys. \n\nIt is not homosexuality or heterosexuality that correlates, IMHO, with the selection of illegal targets, but immaturity, etc. \n\nBTW, I was unaware JJ estimated 5% to 50% gay clergy. IMHO, globally the correct figure today is minimally 50%, and perhaps as high as 75%. Reliable data is virtually impossible given the ongoing preference for the closet among priests.",

I am not an historian, so I can't be sure, but I'm pretty sure that the \"sex for resources\" exchange type of marriage never existed. Up until the early 20th century, I am fairly sure that marriage was fundamentally about securing, maintaining, and extending family wealth. Both men and women were jointly providing services, and both were getting sex, but most negotiations were familial anyway. And even later, once married women were hardly the \"keepers\" of sex - they were subject to the will of their husbands, leading to John Stuart Mill quote on marriage as the invisible tyranny. So anyway, a far cry from this presentation of \"good old days\" marriage as a negotiation between two people, marriage was a familial economic planning activity involving the subjugation of women.  But women still bought in because it was the only way they could have sex without suffering community censure.",

Dark theology breeds corruption and spiritual decay. \n    I DARE you to tell me you have read the letter to the Hebrews in the New Testament and that you are not brainwashed, as so many Catholics are.",

People can use each other, people can have sex thinking only of their own pleasure, people can abuse or rape. Those are perversions. Anal intercourse or oral sex are not perversions as long as both partners are willing and enjoy it. \n\nThe ideal, however, is that sexual activity be between two monogamous people who love each other.

The knives were a variety of hunting knives that were seized in an ILLEGAL search by the police. Shockingly, people do have legitimate reasons for having weapons and it should not be assumed that all are criminals. His sentence was a minimal fine, community service and a gun safety class.

In fact, not only have they traveled deep into the park, but they have spawned, quite successfully in fact, throughout the river and tributaries opened up by dam removal. Salmon, as it turns out, are a very real source of income for thousands of fisherman across the state, and up in Alaska...  \n\nThird, the fix you suggest for US 101 is absurd, and a hell of a lot more expensive and potentially dangerous than building a new bridge.

This was basically the trickle down from this story. \n\nThere is the strong possibility that this was fully intentional. At Maria's canonization Pius XII contrasted the \"the unhealthy marshes and filth of the world\" (read: sex outside marriage) with the \"solemn duty\" to be on guard against said dangers and the mother who \"educated\" Maria to this very martyrdom--and he used that word. \n\nJob well done, mother?  \n\nIt's so twisted I can't even wrap my head around it.

I don't believe that a minor under parental control is capable of breaking immigration law, period. The DACA program brought kids who are American in all ways except paperwork out of the shadows and onto the tax rolls. Like every industrialized nation our population is aging. We sorely need young taxpayers to stave off cuts to SS, Medicaid and Medicare. Tossing these kids, as well as other hard working but undocumented people, out is short sighted and hurts the economy. The world is willing to give it's most precious commodity, young people, to us for free; but as with most other precious resources we're squandering it away.",

How many of these protesting scientists are vegan?  Scientific facts show that the production and transportation of animal-based food has a much bigger carbon-footprint, land-footprint and water-footprint than the production & transportation of plant-based food.  Scientific studies have shown that the consumption of animal-based food is by far the single biggest contributor to human-generated climate change.  So how many of these scientists (who want governments and leaders to accept \"facts\" and change their behavior) are themselves not resisting scientific facts and changing their consumption behavior?  Not a whole lot. I am guessing.  So why criticize Trump or any one else who is skeptical?",

We might as well require a man to wear still the coat which fitted him when a boy as civilized society to remain forever under the regimen of their barbarous ancestors.",

If availability of funds is unlimited then clearly spending any amount to reduce any bad thing is warranted.

In absolute terms, terrorist murder comprises a very small percentage of total murders, yet we spend far more money fighting terrorism than we do fighting other murder.  To do so is irrational, but that is who we are.  \n\nMore generally, I think that murder is reduced not through conviction and sentencing, but through broad public acceptance and support of the value of human life.  When we as a society treat people as disposable, dehumanize them, call them pond scum, drop bombs on them, or kill them via police, we teach individuals that it is okay to solve personal problems through murder, robbery, etc.  We reap the fruit of what we sow.",

I won't be surprised if he appoints a pharmaceutical lobbyist, or executive to Surgeon General. The 1% has literally taken over at the end of his presidency the U.S. will be less secure wages will be down for middle, and lower class. If he abolishes the health care act you will be paying more for insurance probably even car insurance will go up as the industry is unregulated he's doing a very exaggerated version of deregulating that G.W. did.

Actually, that metaphor gives Team Trump entirely too much credit.

His feet are all messed up and he seems lost. The real advantage would be having Osweiler or Lynch running  rollout play action schemes that allows for deeper throws and also allows them to run at any time. The Broncos have great players that can catch and run. That would also give the running game much bigger holes to operate. Siemian won the \"competition\" in camp only because Lynch sucked at this system and can't play his real game which is shotgun rollouts for him to see deeper down the field. Even Osweiler could improve at this. If McCoy sticks to this offense and Siemian remains ineffective, then I think Elway needs to step in at some point and start playing for next season with Lynch.",

American working-class whites have a well-documented history of attacking people who are in the same boat they are (or worse) instead of attacking the super rich who've left them high and dry time and time again. Now they've got and cast their lot with a billionaire who has never displayed in his entire life one iota of sympathy for the plight of workers or the poor. Trump has robbed the poor and workers every chance he's had and it's documented. The American working-class is divided and the Trump portion of it willget what they deserve.",

So, here we are again, simply hoping to better regulate the ownership of firearms in the US so 30,000 Americans don't keep dying on an annual basis largely due to lax laws around firearm storage, usage, and ownership. Trying to compare the ownership of a vehicle to a firearm is just idiotic as the primary utility and purpose of a vehicle is not to harm people but simply to transport them safely from one destination to another.

Now gays, as you admit, make up 4% of the human race, far dwarfing the number of Jews. So the persecution of gays has taken in absolute terms a greater toll (augmented by the absence of a gay community analogous to the Jewish community). It is true that the Nazis focused their paroxysm of hatred on the Jews, a group who had been denounced as deicides in church teaching, condemned to Hell at the Council of Florence, and seens a justly condemned to perpetual servitude by Paul IV in 1555 (Bull, Cum Nimis Absurdum, ratified by popes in later centuries).

Even though I agree we need to, I'm interested in why we are so intent on focusing on the apple barrel rather than the bad apples. Part of the reason, I suspect, is that we want to blame the organisation which for many of us has caused so much grief, abused us personally, and has turned out to be such a disappointment, perhaps exposing us to ourselves that we were so bloody stupid to have ever believed in it. Perhaps we also had and still have our own psychological (bad apple) issues that need addressing, something we may not want to admit. I know I do. So, easier to blame the organisation (the barrell) than blame individuals (bad apples). Perhaps it's because many of us went along with the sexual revolution, are gay and love Vatican II and therefore, cannot even begin to consider these issues to be part of the problem?

Forget the backhanded shout out to \"Joe Populist\" already -- time for a slap to your face: IBM Watson A.I. has recently replaced several dozen jobs that pay $47,000 per year, at just one company in one of the richest countries on Earth... (I'm not going to spell everything out for you G&M, do your own dirty work!) Now does $47K sound like a burger flipper to you?  Or a cashier? This ain't about \"Joe Populist\" as much as it's about JOE HUMAN.",

Mental illness is a factor in all terrorist activity but the effect of Radical Muslim Religious teachings is the big factor. So he informs authorities of his ISIS connection then buys a one way ticket and only checks a bag with a gun and ammo. I know it is politically incorrect to profile but this is textbook.

You are obviously ignorant of both Dignitas Personae, which does not require we become a Catholic nation, including on abortion, even if we have Catholic legislators or equal protection law, which states that it is not the manner of the fetal death that makes a difference, but their legal status before that happens.  Right now, they have none, largely because the one body that could grant it, Congress, has not.  If Congress did grant it in the first trimester, than what happens in the eyes of the state must be equal as far as tort relief and criminal investigation for all embryos and fetuses with personhood.  Otherwise, every medical chart for every abortion would be listed as a miscarriage and that would be that.  Since the idiots who went to Liberty Law School would aggressively prosecute as their ticket to Congress, parents of the miscarried would fight back and rightly so.",

Hawai'i law requires that manufactured cannabis products be permitted and I have yet to see the DOH rules that provide those permits/permissible uses.   \n\nI don't think you give enough credit to locals, who have had to tap into their own resourcefulness for medical cannabis for - arguably - a great many decades.

I have great sympathy for the soldier he killed with the grenade but it was a moment that only those who have been in similar circumstances can understand. Have you been at war moon?",

What about the non-partisan economy experts who say that Trump's plan will result in the worst recession we've seen since the Great Depression? Did you enjoy the recession created by Dubya's tax cuts for the rich and simultaneous initiation of an illegal war? Trump would be a disaster for everyone but himself - as usual.",

Obama did nothing for the economy but hire millions of inept government workers, print money, peddle to illegals and offer them free healthcare while the rest of us subsidized it. There was ZERO gain in the US productivity under Obama and almost ZERO growth except in the tech sector. All the growth you saw was virtual from corporations borrowing out the wazoo at zero percent interest rates to buy back shares and artificially inflate their growth. This is also a reason that the Fed was deathly afraid of raising rates under Obama, because they knew the economy was in a zombie state.",

It helps explain some of his wild behaviour. What he and William have to ask is whether they want to pass that caged bird curse onto their children or whether they'll insist on giving them an opportunity to lead normal healthy lives with normal relationships.\n\nAnd yea, I give Harry credit for his military service even if it was in aid of another useless war.

I believe in our democratic institutions. I believe that eventually Trump will be held accountable in the democratic processes designed by the founders.\nThe real threat of domestic violence in the Trump years, if there is one, will arise among the relatively small number of right wing nuts -- the racists, fascists and neo-nazis who make up his political base -- who, contrary to all reason, believed that Trump could and would do what he promised.  As it dawns on them that he can't and won't, and that in most instances never intended do, the threat of right-wing violence will be very real.  Trump is a racist and a fascist, for sure -- but he's also a plutocrat who will always pursue personal aggrandizement above all else.",

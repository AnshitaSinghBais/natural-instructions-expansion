As I spoke to the woman, I was continually interrupted by the Rape Relief rep, to the extent that I asked her to leave the room.  It turned out that the sex was consensual, and that the woman was actually intent on a guilt/revenge thing.  What actually happened is that following a fight with her boyfriend, she stormed off, went to the party, got drunk and had sex.  Upon returning home, she said \"look what happened to me,\" and then reported it as a rape at the urging of her beau.   Unfounded!!!!! \n I also told the Rape Relief worker to go ahead and complain.

Yes, Weinstein was obviously a lech, but everyone apparently knew that, so why did these women continually put themselves into situations where something could happen?  Why did & do they continue to dress 1/2 or 3/4 naked all the time? Women spend a crazy amount of time and money trying to attract male attention, then cry foul when it's the wrong male who is attracted.   Not saying that some men don't need to learn to control themselves, but the time has come to accept that many times, women are the authors of their own misfortune.  Until we address women's responsibility this problem will never go away.  Sadly it seems that the more men are lectured on avoiding anything sexual with a women and resist their natural instincts, the more women dress and act like whores.  No woman needs to wear an almost see-thru dress with no bra, no underwear and thick war paint, not to mention their actions",

It doesn't matter if Hebron  \"was the oldest jewish settlement on earth\", under past rules where you could keep the land you won, dubious jewish ownership had passed to others.

That is basically true in form but not in substance. In substance a government worker contributes to the economy and the living standards of the country as does a private worker. The private workers must obviously pay for some of the benefits provided by the government workers and the government workers earn their salary and benefits if they are fair.

Example: Prostitution is an act upon the sexual appetite. Legalized prostitution reduces sexual assault, therefore sexual assault is an act on the sexual appetite. So, you think we should encourage one act (prostitution) to discourage another act (sexual assault) on the sexual appetite. Let's apply that idea. You also compared the sexual appetite to other \"legitimate appetites,\" such as hunger. SO. If a person is hungry, then, by your logic, it's also okay for them to steal food. Because if it's okay to visit a prostitute when one is horny, then it's okay to steel food when one is hungry, because what's important here is that we all get to act on our legitimate appetites. Sorry, but I believe it's not unreasonable to expect people to control their sexual urges. It's not okay to commit sexual assault and it's not okay to visit a prostitute.",

Augustine, in one of his sermons, says that a man should look forward to heaven where he can embrace his wife as if she were a statue.\n\nThe ideas that being \"open to procreation\" is desired by God is unsupported by anything in scripture.

We pay 50% of our income to taxes, we expect a healthcare system that works. The healthcare system is clearly broken and suffering from years of neglect, and what really sucks is that some of those on the inside (as you've demonstrated) are exploiting the broken system and taking advantage of the public.\n\nThis should outrage to ALL Canadians. This is not about 2-tier systems. If we want a 2-tier system, it should be legislated and regulated. This is the Medical profession profiteering off an opaque and broken system. It's sick and should be stopped forthwith!\n\nFurthermore, you'll find that the CMA plays a strong roll in limiting the entrance of foreign doctors into Canada - meaning tightening up supply and strengthening their monopoly.\n\nKeep shining a bright light on their unethical practices!",

In most states, a electoral college voter CANNOT vote \"against the state majority\" (even if the \"majority\" is only 51% - which means essentially 49% of the state's votes \"didn't count\") without repercussions (in some states civil, in others criminal). That's how a candidate can win the popular vote and still lose the election - and the electoral college voters have very little choice (although the Constitution doesn't \"bind\" them to casting ALL votes the same as the popular majority for that state, the STATES DO).",

My area of expertise also happens to be in international relations with a focus on Cold War and foreign policy studies.  What I have made is hardly an apples/oranges comparison.  Whenever Russia moves its weaponry anywhere near our NATO allies, it is reported with great concern (as it should be), regardless of the actual numerical value of the troops.  See recent stories on the Iskander missile systems.  Also, it is not only 450 Canadian troops going to Latvia, it is some 3-4,000 NATO troops moving to Latvia and other Eastern European allies on a rotating basis. Sure, it's not 43,000 like the Soviets had in Cuba circa 1962, but capabilities and intent matter far more than numbers. If not, why's NATO concerned with Iskander missiles in Kaliningrad?",

In 1965, the #1 cause of poverty in the black community was single moms, which stood at 17% of births at the time.  So, the Democrats decided to reward being a single mom, and now it stands at 73% of births in the black community.  The system also penalizes them of they get married, or if a kid under 25 gets a job, and they wonder why the unemployment rate in the black community is so high.  The only way a kid can help the family with more money is thru crime; a paycheck reduces mom's benefits!",

Josh Fox knew this and blatantly lied about it in his documentary. The origin of the gas can be proven by determining the type of gas coming out of the faucet. In a CSU study done in Weld County (shown to have flaming tap water in the documentary), gas in water wells has been shown to be biogenic in origin 98% of the time meaning it could not have originated in an oil and gas bearing formation (where thermogenic gas originates from). Rather, it is the result of microbial processes much more shallow than oil and gas and coincidentally right near our aquifers. You can try again, but Gasland has been proven to be a terrible source many times over already.",

I am not an historian, so I can't be sure, but I'm pretty sure that the \"sex for resources\" exchange type of marriage never existed. Up until the early 20th century, I am fairly sure that marriage was fundamentally about securing, maintaining, and extending family wealth. Both men and women were jointly providing services, and both were getting sex, but most negotiations were familial anyway. And even later, once married women were hardly the \"keepers\" of sex - they were subject to the will of their husbands, leading to John Stuart Mill quote on marriage as the invisible tyranny. So anyway, a far cry from this presentation of \"good old days\" marriage as a negotiation between two people, marriage was a familial economic planning activity involving the subjugation of women.  But women still bought in because it was the only way they could have sex without suffering community censure.",

St. Augustine, for example. What was used to celebrate the Last Supper. Likewise, the transubstantiation was an 11th century  idea. \n    I m referring to the renewal as a work of the Spirit, and the description of the Mass referred to in Vatican II documents and Pope Francis as signs of renewal. I am not referring to what I want-that would be grandiose. We don't say \"Thy will be done\" for nothing. \n    I DO want to see renewal. I DON'T believe these Medieval pieties help promote a contemporary spirituality in the context of an ancient tradition. In another vein I am trying to find a truly catholic theology (small \"c\") because the divisions, some of which you refer to in typically retrograde fashion, are a sign of ignorance, stupidity and egotism.

Imposing the peace was disrupted by the assassination, a subsequent weak Presidency, resistance to the Reconstruction, the genocide/defeat of Indian nations of the west, and the Garfield assassination.  The population wanted peace and this created the conditions for rebel extremists to impose jim crow for the next 100 years with minimal opposition, which was the superiority of white person over the African they once owned.  Many of the statues and cenotaphs are purposeful symbols of jim crow which is why they must come down.  Many of the participants attending are the inheritors of this extremism, making a travesty of their democratic right to gather. They align themselves with political Parties and present a veneer of respectability to impose their corruption. The expression of their extremism is hate, it is dangerous and should be outlawed, rigorously investigated, and punished.",

Ostensibly an index of new dwelling prices, the July annual change actually reflects the annual change for June 2017, since the new housing price data on which it is based can only be incorporated with a lag. So the discrepancy between the housing price increases shown between this series and the Teranet National Bank HPI is staggering: it shows an annual increase of 14.2% for June. It can\u2019t be explained by the replacement cost index incorporating changes in VAT since if this were done properly (not that it is) this would tend to make the replacement cost series show higher rates of inflation, the effective VAT rates going up due to rising house prices even when the rates themselves stay the same.",

No it is a hand on the butt, a light kiss, or other act of low rational consequence.  But the squeaky wheel gets the grease.  Whining females and their male enablers make so much noise about being touched (unrelated to sexual intercourse) that the inconsequential is now a fount of conflict.  I think humans will always find things to piss them off.  No matter how close to perfect life is, complainers will still be there.",

The first fascist movements emerged in Italy during World War I, before it spread to other European countries.

The biggest root cause with the state is the state its self. They are there own worst enemy but its all about them & there isn't a single honest official in the state at all.

And yet,  I found most  of the Germans I got to know--including \"Papi\" my future father in law, a 6-year Wehrmacht vet- were very good people.  The problem was Naziism, not Germans.  \nThis led me to my biggest Life question-- how could such good people have done such horrible things?

Sadly, with Betman at the helm, goonery is elevated to the top shelf. As though watching the very best get run down is entertainment. Save our game from this repugnant thuggery.

This was basically the trickle down from this story. \n\nThere is the strong possibility that this was fully intentional. At Maria's canonization Pius XII contrasted the \"the unhealthy marshes and filth of the world\" (read: sex outside marriage) with the \"solemn duty\" to be on guard against said dangers and the mother who \"educated\" Maria to this very martyrdom--and he used that word. \n\nJob well done, mother?  \n\nIt's so twisted I can't even wrap my head around it.

NK invading SK for some reason. Trump pulling out of NATO resulting in Russia invading someone somewhere due to the chaos that ensues, etc.\n\n3.

The knives were a variety of hunting knives that were seized in an ILLEGAL search by the police. Shockingly, people do have legitimate reasons for having weapons and it should not be assumed that all are criminals. His sentence was a minimal fine, community service and a gun safety class. As far as the current charge, surely you've heard of college kids who get drunk and have consensual sex?

L Murphy who abused 200+ deaf kids.  \nListecki asked victims to come forward, promising healing, resolution, fair compensation. .\nIt took me a year to find the courage to come forward \nI stupidly took him at his word\n\nListecki knew all along there would be no healing. He ruthlessly used healing as bait, to trick as many victims as possible to come forward as this was a cheap way to eliminate us all at once\nHe then spent 5 yrs, + millions fighting us, saying not even one victim's claim was valid\nThe result, the archdiocese kept 200+ mil in cash, did not sell 1 property\n\nWe learned Dolan had secretly paid the clergy that raped us, 20k to quietly leave\nIn bankruptcy most victims got much less than the men who raped us\nWe are emotionally destroyed. \nIs this Mercy?",

The engine revs up immediately, then the car starts to accelerate, then the revs die down as the car gets up to speed.    Like a boat coming on plane.     For many people, including me, it's not the type of \"feel\" that's right for a car.     I didn't like it, and didn't like other features on the car after owning and living with it for 2 years, so I sold it.    \n\nNow you can argue until you're blue in the face about personal preferences, but that would be stupid in the extreme.

However, may I relate a short, personal and I think, relevant story.  \n\nI've always been a politically active person.  That didn't set well with a local School District where I was employed.  They found a way to use a \"reduction in force\" to end my employment.  Like Mr. Johnson,  I felt I had been \"royally screwed\" and was extremely bitter.  Fortunately, I was able to \"get over it\" and keep that bitterness from clouding my future.  It wasn't real easy,   I still think the administrators and Board members were a bunch of #@$%$s, but they are $#$%^s \"in the past.\"  I've \"gotten even\" by enjoying the last 30 plus years and, while I've been \"at it\", outliving all of them.\n\n  It sounds like Aaron is doing the same.  \n\nThis will sound a little \"preachy\", but, IMO,  how we handle \"getting screwed\" is more important than \"getting screwed\"  regards and best wishes,   Gary",

So I find Swifts claim of grabbing her 'bare ass' to be not only not credible but ludicrous.  And since 100% of the testimony wasn't that anyone else saw it but that Taylor Swift 'SAID' that it happened, well thats not enough evidence to do anything.  Now if she said that he grabbed her ass and not insisted that he grabbed her bare ass.. well then she has a more credible story at that point. IF that were the claim then I think she has at least a 50/50 chance of winning as it is she has 0.  Neither of these two deserve anything special.",

Government subsidized alcohol and drug residential treatment programs work and we are morons for not funding them.

Can the man go anywhere, do anything within the clerical structures of the Church and not create a mess?  \n\nCard. Burke needs to be removed from his role with the Knights.  This time, he should not be given any other assignment.  The pope could just say he has no other assignment for him at this time.  As a cardinal, he would, of course, participate in any conclave to elect the next pope should we lose Francis.

I am not sure what the big deal is unless you think that a female prostitute being knocked up with a HIV infected baby through one of her \"clients\" is a good thing.  I certainly don't.  These women should be using condoms until they can extract themselves from that situation.",

Most recently the former speaker of the house was convicted of numerous crimes of statutory rape.\n2) The list of anti-gay GOP members caught in homosexual acts are astounding.\n\n\nThe hypocrisy of the right about sex matter is just mindblowing.

The terrorism Republicans have inspired against women is their way of raping women, keeping women in their \"place.\"  They have been allowed to denigrate American women as a whole.  \nWe will no longer tolerate their harassment, their killing of doctors, their bombing of clinics, their politics of misogyny. We will hold the churches who support their terrorism responsible. We can politicize this woman-hating brand of \"Christianity,\" politicize their religious activity.",

As someone who was working a crappy paying blue collar job at the time, I can attest to how hard it was to save the 26k we needed for a downpayment.  I'm not sure that were I in that job today, even making more, based on going pay rates, that I would have been able to buy anything that didn't involve a monster of a commute.  That commute also has associated costs, especially since our transit system here, kinda sucks.\n\nAs I said, I think that people do need to take a hard look at the fact that housing has gone up at 3 or 4x the rate of wage growth, before just writing off millennials as whiners.  I find that they whine about many things that are just how things have always been, but in this case, I'm not sure their whining isn't entirely accurate.",

And now, when it has been possible for some weeks, it is just due to FSB to let it happen, no matter how many criminals or non-criminals are there organising the trip to the border. To let them come is a decision made by FSB and Mr. Ilkka Kanerva is absolutely right when saying that it is a signal sent from Moscow to Helsinki. Another thing is that vast majority of the flow to Finland did not originate to countries at war. Most of them are from countries like India and Pakistan and they have spent many years working in Russia, but now, due to depression in the country, they are seeking for better life in Europe.",

The term post-finasteride syndrome (PFS) has been coined and hundreds of lawsuits have been brought in regard to its sexual side effects, (shrinking penis, poor sexual function) and the drug's effects on cognition, mood and mental states have been documented in the scientific literature. Many users noted a \"disconnection between the mental and physical aspects of sexual function,\" and changes in mental abilities, sleeping patterns, and/or depressive symptoms.

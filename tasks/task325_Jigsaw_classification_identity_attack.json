Just accept it and ignore the CDC talking about the aids epidemic sweeping the nation because of the last 8 years. Maybe we should ignore it and let them do this. Once they die off from sexually transmitted flagrant perversions/  they get what they paid for. \nHomosexuality is (Not love) it's just about having sex. If God is love, Love is not gay sex. \nLove is putting others before yourself. This includes having sex. Real love is not sex(rapeor homosexual tendencies.",

He hated it almost as much as he hated Jews (as his book, ON JEWS AND THEIR LIES, attests). His followers thought they were God's chosen People, too. In his recent book, THE PROTESTANTS, Alec Ryrie notes that Luther's follower -- owing to their great love of God and Scripture -- embarked (years after Luther's death) upon bloody religious wars, burnings, martyrdom and regicide. And among competing Protestants, every opponent became a papal anti-Christ! lol.\n\nOf course, the fiercest hatred today is silent; it is racial hatred. And that is everywhere. And Muslims -- in second place on the hatred chart -- are seen by many as mini-anti-Christ's for believing their faith is true when it is opposed to everyone's else's truth.

The war in 1948 was initiated by the Arabs. It was a war of extermination. Unfortunately for the Arabs, it didn't turn out that way.\n\nBut, what would have happen if Arabs embraced the Jewish nation instead of attacking it?? No one gave that any thought. My guess would be that the Jewish state would be more smaller, weaker and under some sort of protectorate of their Arab neighbors?? Too bad, eh? Palestinian Arabs, instead of sharing, lost it all to the Palestinian Jews.",

(The term latent homosexual is no longer used except as a perjorative because psychology no longer considers homosexuality as a disorder. It never was, they just stopped listening to Catholic bishops who craved not religious freedom but religious power).  Some priests are very queer in affect but would never consider themselves homosexual. There is no reason not to ordain them or any gay man or married man or gay woman or married woman. It\u2019s not a doctrinal issue. It has nothing to do with abuse and everything to do with Trad prejudice. The generation that insisted on that prejudice is dying out. Those of us who were not bold enough to resist are not far behind them but the younger adult generations will force change, not by voting with their feet but with their contribution envelopes.

The Bible is rightly interpreted within the context of the Church's Tradition. Protestants, who believe that they are individually granted the imprimatur to interpret the Holy Scriptures according to their own lights, are in grave error. The whole counsel of God, found in the Bible and inthe rest of Sacred Tradition, does not & never can support the perversion of matrimony that is now called \"gay marriage\". There is no cherry-picking involved here.\n\nFurthermore, you presume a lot when you accuse me of having been raised with homophobia. I have never been afraid of people who claim to be homosexual. Therefore, I am not now, nor have I ever been \"homophobic\", despite your accusation. God does not create gays; \"gays\" decide for themselves to indulge their own lusts. Any sexual sin that is committed by gay people is their own responsibility, not God's",

It was a displacement of my anger, and just didn't know. That belief was deeply infused by my abusers.  That's why, given males abuse in the same rate whether they are gay or not gay, I feel that events like this one require a strategic response from the LGBT community as these events unjustly become gay issues. It's hard not to react, i'm' sure, bcuz some of the stuff said to gay commentators is hurtful, ignorant, way off, and not true.

Pew polls suggest that while a small minority believes in the violence (still a whoopingly high number in absolute terms), they do believe cartoonists should be killed if they portray mohammed.  And they also believe in Sharia law.  Overtime you see a muslim leader or Imam get questioned they say \"Islam\" is a religion of peace, but push them on Sharia, women and gays and its all double speak and changing the subject.

For you having killed your own cat by letting it roam free like expendable roadside litter and then whined about it to everyone, blaming everyone in the whole world but yourself. It's time they did convict you under those animal-protection laws.

It's not nice to try to manipulate your whole community just for attention with your own self-victimizing song & dance act. Even worse, you used your 100%-expendable vermin cat like a convenient animal-sacrifice just for attention from all those around you. If you really cared about your cat the way you claim (read: lie about it) then your cat would still be alive today. Self-evidently, BUSTED!",

Are the two related to some degree? Sure. But homelessness in cities is a fact of life. And I don't see how you can legally ban anyone (or should) from being on public property during daylight and evening hours if they're not bothering anyone and not causing a mess.   \nI worked downtown for a portion of the 80's and 90's helping to maintain the public areas. We cleaned up a lot of  \"stuff\". Some of the people who appeared to be homeless weren't a problem. We even got to know some of them. Some of the younger \"kids\" is where we had most of our problems. Of course, things have gotten a lot worse with drugs, mental illness, etc., and just the sheer number of people downtown.",

It was born out of necessity to be able to communicate & understand in a plantation environment that introduced Multi Nationals to hawai'i for labor.\nI consider the ability to speak & understand pijin as it is used today, as Valuable as the olelo of long ago.  Great effort has been taken & made to Preserve & Perpetuate the olelo so that it can never be forgotten.\nHere's my point. Nobody I know has ever said our Pijin' will be forgotten if we don't continue to use it. Similarly, like the olelo of yester-year, it is Frowned upon to Speak in schools or public & even in families.

The only way you can get the prices you are stating is if you apparently shoehorn yourself into a specific set of circumstances/timing that most of us are unable to do and the airlines know it.  It doesn't take much observation when trying to make a reservation that the airlines set up the system to hit you up for more money for each choice you have to make to get something done.  Yes , others can say you don't need to travel at all or go that time of year, etc., etc., but that is not the reality if you deserve some quality of life.  So, the same airfare is almost $200 cheaper off-season and also cheaper on a \"red eye\", but the cost of flying the plane is mostly the same.  How is that fair, to gouge like the airlines apparently do?",

You want to save thousands per year, live and work where you don't need a car. You will literally be amazed.  I am sorry, I know a lot of people make their living off of cars, but they were a really bad idea -- sorry Henry Ford.  Not to mention the pollution they cause.  When I lived in Chicago, I lived downtown five blocks from where I worked.  I had a car, which was really dumb because I drove it once or twice a month.  But, at the time, I thought you needed to have a car to be a real person.  Most people who live in Manhattan don't own a car.  And Denver can and will change so you don't need a car, if you let and you want it to.",

His instincts are to hold on to the ball and take off.  Does not have the ability to survey the field, look downfield and make accurate throws on a consistent basis.  Only positive thing about Lynch is that he is athletic and is built like a QB (strong, physical, can take hits).  When it is a single read and throw, Lynch is okay completing maybe 60% of those throws.  But if he has to go away from the first read to the 2nd and 3rd read, it is time to run. He cannot read defenses. \nSloter, in the limited time he played, showed more instincts to play QB.  Even when he is running, his eyes are downfield.  Lynch is not looking to throw when he is running.\nBroncos short yardage offense is still a struggle.  Cannot pickup 1 yard on 3rd or 4th down.\nMcKenzie and Henderson demonstrated potential.  Boles was solid.  Sambraillo and Stephenson are still huge liabilities.",

How the Post can be advocating sticking to such a lackluster series of policies and people is beyond me. If you want kids who can't read and charter chains making money hand over fist, feel free to support the Post's recommended candidates.

Reagan stood up to their bullying and put an end to their soft tyranny.  Thank goodness unions are in decline.\nWhat spawned Trump was 8 years of Obama, political correctness run amok, 95 million unemployed/under-employed, and the prospect of a Hillary Clinton Presidency.  If the Democrat Party doesn't stop its march to the ideological left fringe, only California, New York, and Illinois will remain to them.",

Foreign tax credits make allowance for the fact that foreign income has already been subject to foreign tax as allowed by treaty. The dividend tax credit attempts to integrate the taxes paid by a Canadian corporation when it is distributed with those levied on an individual had they earned the income directly. They operate to prevent both double tax and tax deferral. The half inclusion on capital gains provides some relief from the taxation of inflation that occurs overtime as investors hold investments it also provides some incentive for risk taking for without it the capital businesses need would be substantially reduced.

In the short term that may actually boost dental outcomes for kids, but the potential harm to the community as a whole exists, as many others here have documented. So why not just provide fluoride varnishes for kids? If we can subsidize Boeing's hazardous waste disposal surely we can protect our kids teeth.\n\nI never said Delta profits from smoking cessation programs, and just because someone does something good doesn't mean everything they do is good.

The Freedom Caucus, who favored a straight repeal with no replacement AHCA, had the votes to insure the defeat of the bill.  Trump threatened them in every way possible.  They refused to be bullied.

You seem to be saying that the government felt they could win, but decided to bring a Category 5 sh!t-storm down on themselves by compensating Khadr anyway.\n\nIf people feel that the government shouldn't have compensated Khadr they're entitled to that opinion. But as you've surely noticed, many people are saying Khadr shouldn't be compensated because he was a terrorist; his father was a terrorist; his whole family are terrorists; we didn't torture him; the Charter is wrong and should be abolished, etc, etc. In cases like that, the opinion is either ill-informed, ignorant and/or anti-Charter. And there's nothing wrong with saying so.\n\nAs for those who claim the government should've decided against settling as a judgment call, I have yet to hear of a compelling reason. And the hindsighters would be equally critical if the government spent millions going to court, only to pay double the amount in the end.",

But he is far closer to the conservative principles I prefer than was Hillary. He is far better at listening to advice than Obama or Hillary ever were, he is decisive, and he is a lot smarter than you or the press assume (or are you really admitting \"the most prepared person ever\" got soundly beaten not only by a novice, but by an idiot with fewer staff and spending far less money as well?). You may disagree with his policies, but he will be a capable president. Making up stuff about what you think Trump might do is just a waste of time since you begin with a made up view of the man. The campaign rhetoric is over, it's time to move on.\n\nAnd give it up on beating the \"she got more votes\" dead horse.

But a reader understanding that the slur was \"c*nt\" would \"get it\" quickly and viscerally. How despicable.\n \nWhat I find distressing is that Sanders is not vigorously condemning this type of behavior. It would take nothing at all away from his support, other than a trivial number of \"psychos,\" and it would not diminish his issues in the slightest.\n\nI think we are seeing a facet (not all) of Sanders' core character, and I think it's enough to disqualify him.\n\n-- Paul",

As he takes money from every Alaskan he gives his buddy 500 grand a year to push for a gas line that doesn't pencil out and keeps giving special contracts for cash to his former law partner to push the line.  He also blew state money flying his wife to Japan with him just so he didn't have to be alone while pushing his gas line.   There's a reason Walker could never get elected on his own---he was a poor choice for governor. Today every man woman and child is paying the real price for his election.    Also take a close look at those who spent hundred's of thousands on ad's supposedly claiming the majority wanted Walker to take half our PFD. What do they stand to gain by the state getting more money to blow ? It's a sad state of affairs when the word steal has been changed to re-structure .  Politicians aren't done . Next year they'll come back for the rest of the PFD.  Recall Walker !",

The big ILH programs can cherry-pick talent from across the state with no restrictions and can afford better facilities, better equipment, and more and better coaches.  The OIA's sole advantage is that it has far more teams, which increases the probability that in any given year it can field one or two teams capable of competing head-to-head with the ILH's elite.  Under those circumstances it should be no surprise at all that the OIA is opposed to any playoff format that could force its champion to beat two top ILH teams to win a state title.  Knocking off the ILH's best is already asking a lot given the ILH's intrinsic advantages.\n\nI agree with you that it's unfortunate that the end result has been to decrease the overall size of the playoffs and a better compromise is needed.

Established scientific theories have withstood rigorous scrutiny and are a comprehensive form of scientific knowledge...\nIn everyday non-scientific speech, 'theory' can imply that something is an unsubstantiated and speculative guess, conjecture, idea, or, hypothesis; such a usage is the opposite of the word 'theory' in science.... The strength of a scientific theory is related to the diversity of phenomena it can explain. As additional scientific evidence is gathered, a scientific theory may be rejected or modified if it does not fit the new findings; in such circumstances, a more accurate theory is then desired.\"",

The money it uses comes from the taxpayer in the form of taxes. Like now, more don't pay than do so the upper 50% will pay all the medical taxes. How much do you think that will come to Andi? If you got a pay check, just how much do you think would come out of it? 40%? 50%? More? You would pay with no regards to how those non payers abuse themselves and the system.

Or even a bit concerned.\n\nFor 20 or so years, from the time the idea first began circulating as a viable idea - for a minority at the time - in the 90s, there's been a relentless program to convince large swathes of the population that it's perfectly okay for the state to legislate that doctors (who swear an oath to save lives, or used to) can now, if a patient asks it, kill the patient.  And it's okay for them to outright kill someone.  \n\nSure there are criteria for this - but criteria can change.  Sure patients have to 'ask' for it - thought they're at their most vulnerable when they do, as Ms Wente points out about the elderly  - but that too could change.  And no one, as they trumpet the right to die with dignity, remembers that they're asking someone to take on the weight of taking the life of another.",

Robert Mueller served the United States as a prosecutor working on cases including the prosecution of Manuel Noriega, mob boss John Gotti, and Pan Am Flight 103. He  sifted through the rubble of the Lockerbie bombing, including children's shoes and teddy bears. Robert Mueller served the United States as F.B.I. director, a position he accepted one week before 9/11. He served under two presidents from both parties, and had the longest tenure as F.B.I. director, second only to Hoover. Gingrich suggests that when it comes to Trump, however, Mueller is unable to operate objectively and is eager to abandon his integrity. Gingrich is acting like a surrogate stooge and should recall: \"Robert Mueller is superb choice to be special counsel. His reputation is impeccable for honesty and integrity. Media should now calm down.\u201d -Gingrich, May 17.",

Only if we've decided to teach them that the world is ending in a couple of decades (yes, my son had college classmates who actually believe it) & that the world is a disaster that has no redeeming qualities - that's on the adults, not the kids, & not even the world at large.\n\nMy son had a childhood friend who committed suicide a couple of years after we moved.  His mother had died after a long bout with cancer, & he didn't manage well (he was 14).  Dad was busy, much older siblings away at college, & he mentioned to friends that he couldn't stand not having his mom around. Of course they had no idea what he really meant. It hit my son very hard, as he is the type of person peers confide in. He thought he might have been able to rescue his friend if he still lived near.  He made a promise to himself to never stay mad at anyone because you don't know if they have pain that might make them commit suicide.",

Marching on the airport because our new President is taking executive action against immigration will not do anything to stop the widespread corruption running your state. If you do not speak out, the corruption will continue as usual as the corrupt no longer fear you.

Of course, Shurtz could always resign before discipline is imposed and then the issue would be moot.  It works like that in the military where officers are sometimes allowed to resign for the good of the service.  Shurtz should resign for the good of the law school as her return would generate further controversy over her status as a professor.  To end the controversy she must not return and that clearly is in the best interests of the law school at this time.  Shurtz has become a liability and likely cannot be an asset in the future.",

Denying the self-determination of Jews in their historic homeland is anti-Semitic as it discriminates against Jews whereas self-determination of other cultures and religions are conferred upon them, just listen to the Palestinians, their leaders and supporters, who claim self-detemination for their people. Criticism is legitimate, however holding Israel in contempt and opprobrium and out of proportion to any other party in the Middle East, and claiming that Israel has no right to exist, is well beyond mere criticism.",

A few think that Russia is still  the old Soviet Union. They still believe the Russians  are Communists,   like China and North Korea actually  are. They have no problem giving  Xi Jinping  a royal red carpet welcome when he visited Seattle in September 2015.  That  same year the Chinese hacked every major corporation in the United States. Yep. They did. All under Obama, by the way!   Hypocrisy is sure  never picky who it chooses to infect.",

A war where Israelis were outnumbered, out of positions and facing the second holocaust. Its sound bit more civil  then what their enemies were saying...\"kill all Jews\"....!! The war in 1948 was initiated by the Arabs. It was a war of extermination. Unfortunately for the Arabs, it didn't turn out that way.\n\nBut, what would have happen if Arabs embraced the Jewish nation instead of attacking it?? No one gave that any thought. My guess would be that the Jewish state would be more smaller, weaker and under some sort of protectorate of their Arab neighbors?? Too bad, eh? Palestinian Arabs, instead of sharing, lost it all to the Palestinian Jews.",

Some people seem to feel that any statement made by a bishop or monsignor in the Vatican is infallible while the other extreme is the gang who feel that only those formal statements by the pope to which they unanimously agree can claim infallibility. Francis seems to hold that the sensus fidelium is a relevant factor in the process. Others seem to point out that infallibility refers only to doctrinal pronouncements addressed to all the faithful, not to approval or disapproval of conduct by individuals.\nIf we can clarify what the dissenters mean by the teaching authority of the Church we can skip a lot of silly debates.\nBill Keane",

The drug and psychological treatment could also be brought to them. The medical expenditures would also come down if medical vans like the Waikiki Out Reach were to service the camps so bandages could be changed, etc. without using EMS to take them to the ER for the same purpose.

There is no effort to explore points of view of a subject as it devolves to cheap shots leading to overtalking one another all at once.

Leaving ANY cat out in nature, alive OR dead, is no better than intentionally poisoning your native wildlife to death. I know this. I fed some wildlife and their offspring that they had while under my care with one of the hundreds of shot-dead cats on my lands. Those native animals then promptly died from some disease in that invasive-species cat-meat. Cats truly are complete and total wastes-of-flesh.

After all, since LBJ's \"Great War On Poverty\" began in the mid-sixties, TRILLIONS of dollars have been spent yet the number of Americans at or below the poverty level has remained remarkably consistent at around the 14-15% level where it is today, fifty some years later.  If Democrats understand all the nuances of poverty then why is that the case?  It's a good thing we're talking about some accountability in the budget although it's a bad thing that the Democrat's contribution to the discussion consists mainly of running around like chicken little, crying about how the sky is falling and we're all gonna die if this budget is passed.",

Sadly I think he will be gone within a year. \n\nI think there is a very real possiblity that he is little more than a con artist like Ron Rewald.  Do you remember him or are you too young?  Then the republican party will have to answer for going with a con artist.  Sad, just sad.",

Former Kenyan citizen Barack Obama arrogantly refused to produce his long-form birth certificate, which he should have done when he was running for president in 2008. Trump should be commended for publicizing the issue; he was the one who shamed Obama into finally producing it in April 2011, about three years after Obama should have done so. It is a fair criticism that Trump kept at this issue even after the release of the long form birth certificate when he should have dropped it. However, if Obama hadn\u2019t joked in a banquet speech, in Trump\u2019s presence, about how now that he had produced the long form certificate Trump could get on with questioning the moon landing, Trump probably never would have run for office. Why does Ibbitson fail to see that Obama behaved like an insufferable twit? We hit peak Ibbitson long ago, and the descent has been steep.",

The fact that I ended up with a modest pension in the mix was a fortunate accident as I initially signed on with no promise of that.  Pensions promised, however, are part of a contractual agreement.

The covenants constitute a contract that runs with the land and is legally binding on all owners.  At closing, the buyer signs a statement that he agrees to this.  So it is disingenuous for an owner to later claim ignorance.  Before doing something, ASK FOR PERMISSION.  It's that simple.  In most cases, reasonable boards will work with owners.

Terrorists are wearing Burkas to hide RPG's and bombs. BAN this crap! Protect our people! The terrorists have brought this to America and if we don't do something NOW, we are going to end up with more terrorists attacks. Burn the Quaran, burn their clothes, their mosques. Ban everything about this religion. If people want to practice their Muslim beliefs then they can leave America. Their religious freedom is not more important than the safety of millions of American lives. You can't ration with religious fanatics. They will happily die for their cause.",

I made the mistake of switching from AT&T to GCI, I'm going back to AT&T as soon as it is feasible, GCI's coverage is garbage, particularly in some areas of the lower 48 and Canada, plus it's astronomically expensive through Canada.

Booking the exact same fight and same day with the same carrier was just $40 more then extra 'fee' from airmiles.  Airmiles stated this was a navigation fee of $556 and was from the carrier. When I pointed out the carrier ticket costs including all fees, about $226 in taxes and fees, was just 40 more then the airmiles navigation fee they said nothing they could do because it was from the carrier. So I called the carrier. The carrier explained they do not assess this fee and the loyalty provider was basically full of it. So not only was there extra fees to 'reward' airmiles for my loyalty but I'd also have to burn a lot of points to end up saving $40 and have the frustrating experience of trying to book on their user unfriendly byzantine system . I will no longer use their points system as it is basically a fraud.",

The economy is growing slower than expected!  Isn't that what the deficit was suppose to fix?   Remember, unlike Harper, Trudeau is not facing the largest global recession since the 1930s.  In fact, he is not facing any recessions and is still running multi-billion, multi-year deficits. \nClearly, either Trudeau, Butts and Morneau can't add the cost of all their expensive promises or they purposely mislead Canadians on the costs.\nSecond, Trudeau is also  lying to us again on replacing the Canadian fighters simply because he knows that in any fair and transparent competition the F-35s would win.",

He has been at it since March and has not found or produced any evidence.

Manafort and Gates were indicted for alleged crimes unrelated to the Trump Campaign.  Papadopoulos got nailed for lying about something that was not illegal.  Stupid.

The second rape involved a 28 year old Moslem male who raped a mentally disabled white woman in August, 2016.\nInterestingly, these rapes have been downplayed by the Mayor and the police in Twin Falls, possibly due to the influence of Ulukaya and the growing number of Moslem refugees.

But as our population increases, so does the rate that we consume resources, the rate that we foul our nest. One of the reasons for our exponential population growth is that we strive to eliminate threats to our existence, destroying predators, curing disease, and trying to control natural disasters. If we stand back and let nature take its course, people will die.  As the weak & unfit die off, our race becomes stronger, better able to cope with the realities of life.

It is also well documented that the Conservative Party backed away from supporting the deal after they were defeated.\n\nThe potential issue of the Saudi Kingdom employing these weapons against their own people was well covered by the Globe and Mail.  This was an issue troubling to the new government as it was to many Canadians.  In the end, money and workers employed in Liberal ridings carried the day.

The truth is that the liberals introduced changes to legislative procedure that effectively amount to permanent time allocation on 100% of bills introduced in the HOC. There is nothing wrong with using time allocation. There is nothing wrong with using your time to filibuster either. Both are perfectly legal and democratic tools.\n\nWhen our electoral system elects a conservative government it is broken, but when it elects Liberals it is fine. When the LPC and NDP filibuster an the Conservative government has to use time allocation they are \"shutting down debate\", but when the Liberals propose changes that will permanently shut down debate that is AOK.

Weapons carried to school included various high-power hunting rifles and big-bore shotguns, as well as in a few instances, fully automatic 9mm STEN submachine guns of World War II vintage.  (A bit late to wonder now, but I expect no concealable firearms were considered because general gun ownership did not bear any stigma in that society at that particular time.)\n\nI do not recall any accounts of rampant misuse of guns in such schools; what memoirs or documentation exist fail to tell of students killing students or an increase in schoolyard robberies or intimidation, despite loaded guns merely left leaning against classroom walls during school hours.\n\nI will concede this involved older children, but kids nonetheless.",

Our neighborhood watch people were threatened by people saying \"We know where you live!\" so that activity was suspended.  Our citizens witness many infractions and call the police--speeding, drug sales, illegal fireworks, loose dogs in the streets, to name a few--but the police say we live in a shit neighborhood, so what should we expect?  \n\nI expect some people in the HPD chain of command, the Prosecutor's office, and other authorities to have some administrative action taken (letters reprimanding them, pay docked, something) and procedures improved or legislation enacted to help the citizens of Ewa Beach.",

Therefore, I am not now, nor have I ever been \"homophobic\", despite your accusation. God does not create gays; \"gays\" decide for themselves to indulge their own lusts. Any sexual sin that is committed by gay people is their own responsibility, not God's",

We can curb the damage it will cause, or we can ravage the earth and let history remember this president as the one who turned his back on future generations and literally ruined the earth.\n\nIf he does back out then that means that consumers will have to be extra cautious about their emissions and what kinds of companies they support.

I replied I think it sucks all around. Mostly that it's gotta suck to be homeless and that it's gotta suck to be paying rent and living next to the trail.

As an adult male survivor of childhood sexual abuse who happens to be heterosexual and whose abusers were all males, for a very long time, I did not like gay people especially gay men.  After years of working on the trauma and discovering that rape is about power not sex, I was finally able to see how wrong I was. I was a kid (abused from age 12 to 16) it was my default reaction. It was a displacement of my anger, and just didn't know. That belief was deeply infused by my abusers.  That's why, given males abuse in the same rate whether they are gay or not gay, I feel that events like this one require a strategic response from the LGBT community as these events unjustly become gay issues. It's hard not to react, i'm' sure, bcuz some of the stuff said to gay commentators is hurtful, ignorant, way off, and not true.

You are trusting others to do your thinking.\n\nOnce you do the math and compare it to the reality you can verify yourself, you will learn that your intelligence has been sabotaged. The earth does NOT curve 8 inches per mile squared, as the math would require for a ball earth. It doesn't curve at all. I can see the base of a mountain, at the same elevation as I, that is more than 30 miles away. If the earth was round, with the claimed dimensions, the base of that mountain should be more than 600 feet below the horizon, yet I can see the valley floor rise into it's base.",

Well there's a big, fat, juicy one right there. He changed it at a whim, opening the door for every homophobic, misogynistic, reactionary right wing cleric who felt that their own church wasn't hating homosexuals and women enough.\n\nOn the upside, Benny showed that you can change anything and 2000 years of tradition can be dropped like hot cakes, and I hope that Francis makes full use of the precedent set by him.",

All the while claiming purity of soul and body with caring and compassion.  The dark side of this monolith continues today through brainwashing and physical assault by self-created messengers of a non-existent, invisible being.

The article noted that Snowflake Snookie had published a map of vulnerable Democrat-held districts that identified those districts with crosshairs. Loughner was nuts, as \"scuppers\" points out, so no one knows what set him off that fateful day. Giffords was not anti-gun, as far as any normal person would understand, even having signed on to a lawsuit in D.C. to overturn the prohibition on possession of firearms in one's home.\n\nSince getting her brains blown out, Giffords has opposed the ability of criminals, terrorists and the mentally ill to acquire firearms.  The NRA and almost all Republican opposed that bill. In Alaska, NRA VP Wayne Anthony Ross successfully overturned a ruling by judge Natalie Finn that a delusional psychotic could have his concealed carry permit revoked, because he failed to notify a responding officer that he was carrying a loaded firearm. The NRA calls such people, \"customers,\" and \"honored members.\"",

Only the strong survive, not only physically but mentally.  I think coaches need to back off and let the players play. Let the QB call the majority of plays. Let the defensive linebackers call the formations. Let the coaches run players in and out keeping them fresh. Once you can establish field position, then open things up and strike when odds are in your favor. Teams need more discipline including the coaches.

If availability of funds is unlimited then clearly spending any amount to reduce any bad thing is warranted.  In reality, resources are limited and decisions regarding optimal use of funds must be made.  For every decision to spend money on one thing, we spend less on something else.  In absolute terms, terrorist murder comprises a very small percentage of total murders, yet we spend far more money fighting terrorism than we do fighting other murder.  To do so is irrational, but that is who we are.  \n\nMore generally, I think that murder is reduced not through conviction and sentencing, but through broad public acceptance and support of the value of human life.  When we as a society treat people as disposable, dehumanize them, call them pond scum, drop bombs on them, or kill them via police, we teach individuals that it is okay to solve personal problems through murder, robbery, etc.  We reap the fruit of what we sow.",

Meanwhile the economy stagnates and, despite a weaker C$, our economy has not been buoyed by US economic strength. Nor is his continual emphasis on immigration/refugees a core concern of the \"middle class\" he claims to serve. Instead he makes common cause with blue collar Canadians by holidaying with billionaires and insisting on 3 nannies. JT thinks that lurching further left is the answer but his policies only deepen our economic malaise and the chasm between the PM's words and deeds.

When I came to Alaska there was a State Income tax, and honestly, I believe it should be reinstated, but I also attended a former Governor Jay Hammond's fund raiser on 15th Street years ago when he announced the Alaska Permanent Fund before it reached the media and the intention of that fund; it was never meant for for state government use.  During the last 20 years when faced with fiscal challenges during 3 recessions, though temporary, Juneau screamed to tap the Permanent Fund instead of rolling back pet-peave programs and other unnecessary programs that would of come close to balancing the budget.  Spend happy politicians needs to go; particularly those who abuse Per-Diem.

To get pleasure out of planning to and then  ending the life of an intelligent, innocent creature is not something to be proud of and promote as a sport. Nor is it necessary for most people to hunt to survive. I find it hypocritical in the extreme when the same people who kill innocent animals in cold blood and justify their actions by saying it is for food (when there is a multitude of non-animal food available and it's actually healthier), then  condemn an animal for attacking and/or killing humans who threaten them or that they see as a source of food.",

His Supreme Court pick sent America out of it's tailspin and his next pick will send America in the right direction for the next 30 to 40 years . On the Alaska front Trump's change in direction will help our state big time and save lives by opening the life saving King Cove road.  Obamacare is failing and he's ready and waiting to sign a law that will end and replace it.  His sending rockets into Syria send a loud message we won't tolerate people gassing their own people . His goal of ridding America of illegal criminals should be applauded by all. He's trying to bring American's together as opposed to Obama's dividing us based of color and how much we earn.

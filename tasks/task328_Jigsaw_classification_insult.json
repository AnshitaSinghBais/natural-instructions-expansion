None of the other 60 women over 40 years laid a charge when they were molested or raped. And the 1 woman who is now accusing him on the charge he is facing waited over 10 years to blow the whistle. Why? Why will a second trial be any different to the first? The fact that he involved himself with so many women and none of them charged him criminally raised some doubt that this one is any different. I'm all for rapists being locked up, but then the victim must lay the charge and the person accused must have a fair trial within a reasonable time while memories of what may or may not have happened can still be properly recalled. Rape is a serious allegation carrying serious consequences. And rightly so. But innocent until proven guilty doesn't seem to apply to Bill Cosby though.",

I am not an historian, so I can't be sure, but I'm pretty sure that the \"sex for resources\" exchange type of marriage never existed. Up until the early 20th century, I am fairly sure that marriage was fundamentally about securing, maintaining, and extending family wealth. Both men and women were jointly providing services, and both were getting sex, but most negotiations were familial anyway. And even later, once married women were hardly the \"keepers\" of sex - they were subject to the will of their husbands, leading to John Stuart Mill quote on marriage as the invisible tyranny. So anyway, a far cry from this presentation of \"good old days\" marriage as a negotiation between two people, marriage was a familial economic planning activity involving the subjugation of women.  But women still bought in because it was the only way they could have sex without suffering community censure.",

Paul rather than Jesus is more accurately considered the \"founder\" of Christianity.  The church that emerges in the New Testament is one that is not only democratic and charismatic but down right socialist [check out Acts].

With tens of thousands of Korean and Chinese women reportedly being forced to be sex slaves, you would think that at least one of them would have come forward to make the allegation immediately after the war, yet none did.   It was not until the 1992, about 47 years after the war ended, that a researcher reported about the Japanese military operating brothels for its soldiers staffed with \u201ccomfort women\u201d or \u201csex slaves\u201d from the occupied territories.

Maybe then there would be an investigation and family placement. In my sons case they took the child and had her in fostercare within an hour. No contact with family happened for 3 days. They are suppose to contact the family immediately, before foster homes, and try to keep the family together. Hmmmm no money in that scenario...There is suppose to be a committee of 5 to oversee OCS, that's a federal law. Alaska does not have one. The Feds can't change that unless there are enough complaints. Murkowski's office won't touch it. Why??? My girlfriend's son was sexually molested in fostercare!!!",

Averages can be skewed by very  high/low earners, a more useful number is median salary.

But the traditional practices continued in the old world. The council of Trent's statement about divorce and remarriage, in the 16th century, was adjusted to not condemn the Eastern practice. Also, Henry VIII never had a divorce, he only had annulments, and the Church of England's position on divorce and remarriage was for some time the same as the Latin Church. The ecclesiastical divorce and remarriage that was once the traditional practice of Eastern Catholics is the same as that now practiced by the Orthodox. If you really believe they're equivalent to annulments, you should have no problem if Rome adopts the Orthodox practice.",

Brock was never going to live up to the HUGE expectations of that massive contract they gave him. And the CLE trade was more just a deal of convenience.  He's just not that good.  HOU way overpaid and it was pretty much a doomed situation from the start.  \n\nHowever, he may very well be good enough to be a solid backup QB at an appropriate backup QB salary.  Yeah, there were a few hard feelings with how his exit went down here, but I don't think it was anything irreparable.  Heck, even Von Miller dissed Elway last year when he cropped him out of the White House picture. But they both rose above it and moved past it.\n\nI find the whole situation of him likely coming back now kinda funny, actually.

This is not meant to favor abortion, but, in some cases, and depending upon very-individual circumstances, it may be the best option.\n\nBack in the pre-Roe days, unwanted children were sent to homes, where they were mistreated, and sometimes sent to foster homes, where they were equally mistreated.  If a baby wasn't perfect in every way, it generally went unadopted.  I remember when pregnant girls used to be sent to Excelsior Home for Wayward Girls.  (It's called a \"youth center\" today.  Boys tried to break in.)  Many wayward girls were sent to convents to have their babies among the nuns.  In both cases, they returned to school the next year, and no one ever even knew what had happened.  Very sad.  I sometimes wondered if some of the babies were killed at birth, as they were on plantations in the south if they were mulatto.",

Women's sexuality is different than men's so women are different and they must be treated differently.  \nThis view of theology fails to see how many other areas in which women and men are similar.

It's just not worth it.\n\nTrucks should be in a restricted lane, and passing should be prohibited, except in designated areas.\n\nConcurrent with this should be driver education about lane discipline and yielding (instead of blocking) when a car comes up from behind.    It is not up to drivers to enforce the speed limit.    So if a car is tailgating - just move over and let him/her pass.    Don't be a stubborn jerk and block traffic, which should be ticketable offence.     That will help traffic flow, and if the tailgater is really speeding (or weaving in and out) leave it up to the police to catch them.",

Mylan isn't \"evil\"-  they're just playing the cards they've been dealt.\n\nSo yeah,  I find Hillary's \"shock\" over this matter more than a bit disingenuous- she knows damn well what the problem is, because she and her ilk have contributed mightly over the years to create the problem.",

They wisely (IMO) chose to not \"storm\" the apartment and force a possible armed conflict.  I certainly agree with that decision.  However, if I'm understanding things correctly, they left the scene with the intent of \"arresting him later.\"  That makes no sense to me.  It may have taken time to negotiate his surrender, but it would have been time well-spent.  If, in fact, he had a gun and had threatened the girlfriend, it makes no sense to me to say, in essence, \"Hey, we're leaving now....see you later.\"  It seems there's a lot of \"middle ground\" between \"killing the guy\" and walking away from the scene.......What do you think?  thanks, Gary",

Before predicting things, ashpenaz, read DISPUTATIONS CONCERNING THE CHRISTIAN FAITH, by Robert Bellarmine, S.J., in which work he argues forcefully for the rationality of Catholic theology against Lutheranism and Calvinism. I doubt Francis will ditch his fellow Jesuit's brilliant work for \"Lutheran sacraments or ordinations\" or for Luther's two Catechisms (never seriously taken as works of academic theology). I am sure, too, Luther's understanding of the role of the \"godly prince,\" which effectively insisted that a monarch had total control of the church, would not sit well with him (as it didn't sit well with republican Calvin). Your predictions seem to have more affinity within your heart, wanting to assure some pseudo- event, than with current ecumenical theology. You mean well, but prediction is not a pastoral remedy.",

Decent moral analysis has to do with the question scripturalists evade - were gays born/created that way?  The CDF letter (not even an encyclical) said gays were disordered (a natural law sophistry, not a scriptural term) because we were all getting too close to allowing gay marriage, which would damage the Catholic brand and become inconvenient for those who blame child sex abuse on gays.

The upper dam could have been similarly drilled under to allowed the lakes to refill in flood season, protecting downstream property and then used as a reservoir in Summer. We spent millions of scarce tax dollars for the aesthetics of a \"wild\" canyon for a few tourists. Once the lakes were drained the dams could collapse in an earthquake with no real harm done, but would likely stand if a seismic sensor automatically opened the drains if things started rocking. Now we have to spend millions more each year repairing flood damage and building new reservoirs, which will likely have their own hazards, and the animals and birds that had come to rely on those lakes for habitat had to move on or die.

In the case of Oklahoma the cause is injecting large amounts of waste water into the Arbuckle formation (much larger amounts than what we inject here in Colorado). The Arbuckle has unique characteristics that make it different than the formations we inject water into in Colorado, one being it directly overlies crystalline basement rock. The interface between the Arbuckle and the basement rock is the perfect spot for a fault to slip when lubricated/pressured up.

Hearsay is an out of court statement, made in court, to prove the truth of the matter asserted. In other words, hearsay is evidence of a statement that was made other than by a witness while testifying at the hearing in question and that is offered to prove the truth of the matter stated. For example, Witness A in a murder trial claimed on the stand: \"Witness B (the \"declarant\") told me that the defendant killed the victim.\" The definition of hearsay is not too difficult to understand.

The numbers you're providing are regarding child molesters in particular. \nFurther, if you look at the line directly before the line you've cited, it reads: \"The researchers reported that 5.1 percent of the child molesters in the study were rearrested for a new sex crime within 3 years of their release...\" meaning that 95% of child molesters were not re-arrested for a new sex crime. \nThe numbers you have cited have to do with comparing subsets of child molesters: those with more than one prior arrest versus those with only one type of prior arrest. \nLastly, regarding the bit that starts with \"As might be expected...\", what they're saying here is that child molesters were more likely than other types of sex offenders to commit a sex crime against a child after release, which is different than re-offense rates.\nDoes that clear things up?",

God cares that we treat each other with love, both in irregular unions and dealing with them.  God is with the lovers, not the accusers.  I hope the book helps priest sort themselves out on this, especially when families demand that their gay sons' marriage be blessed. It will be a trend none can stop.",

The whole point of affirmative action is positive, to open the opportunity of higher education to those to whom it is otherwise denied. That is to the good of the nation. In the meantime, those white students who qualify can in every case find an acceptable school to attend. Opposition to affirmative action is based on racism, pure and simple.\n\nThe notion of \"races\" is an error. There are only homo sapiens with different amounts of melanin.

They at first refused to provide the reasons why: it took some time to learn that his wife, who was unable to adjust her work schedule, could not attend the required meetings for wives, and so they threw my cousin out.

The oft repeated 'Christ chose only men as priests' is an example. There were NO Christian priests for over 300 yrs; priests were needed in other religions to perform sacrifices, Christians have no need to perform sacrifices except those of 'thanks and praise'. \nIt is good that we can seek to understand the Living God, the Scripture and Church history in the light of our increasing knowledge, and to offer faithful commitment to God (not the Institution) without fretting about the diversity of expression or condemning those with whom we do not agree.",

SB21 is the only tax scheme in the last 20 years that has actually allowed an increase in production despite the low oil price environment worldwide that has devastated the industry and resulted in layoff of hundreds of thousands of workers.  The producers have lived up to the commitment that they made to the people of the State of Alaska when SB21 repeal was voted down and have spent billions to ramp up production and keep the pipeline operating.  Now the Democrats want to punish the industry and go back on the State's commitment to the industry.  If this happens more layoffs will occur, projects will be shut down, and the State will once again dry up as production drops.  This is how the State of Alaska rewards success ??\n\nJohn Lawson\nAnchorage",

They don't seem to be doing a good job of this as evidenced by the visiting Imam to a mosque in Montreal who preached killing jews one by one; and apparently no Muslim in the mosque reported this incendiary speech to the authorities. Our government could best use their resources to combat Islamism (per example) rather than a mis-guided and wrong headed effort to combat Islamophobia by bill M-103. The sharia law of the Islamists provides for harsh penalties for criticism of the koran, Islam or Mohammed and it seems to me bill M-103 borrows from the ideology of the Islamists as it attempts to enshrine in Canada protection against criticism of Islam when in some instances, criticism should be made rather than covered up.",

An appeal a few months after the article was written reduced the fines to zero)\n\nThe reason for the sentences and fines in the first place was the refusal by the two professors to abide by a court-ordered injunction.  Jail is common in such circumstances for, example, labour leaders.\n\nOne of the reasons for the successful appeal was the fact that the two professors were first nation people - which goes in the opposite direction to your claim.\n\nFor the full appeal decision, see: \nhttps://www.canlii.org/en/on/onca/doc/2008/2008onca534/2008onca534.html?searchUrlHash=AAAAAQARInJvYmVydCBsb3ZlbGFjZSIAAAAAAQ&resultIndex=5",

Once one grasps the constancy of theological development in the past, the Tradition becomes a great friend, for it is the unassailable warrant for the changes we desperately need today. \n\nIncidentally, in my view, it is not just historical depth in time but also historical breadth in geography (the Byzantine, Syrian, Egyptian Traditions) of the first millennium that warrant change. Since the Great Church (as come call it) of the first millennium was largely united, all the theologies of  all those culturally diverse Churches are fully valid today as markers in the past of what could be in the future. You may recall for example, that before the two recent synods, the wide range of possible solutions for remarried Catholics included the practice of the Byzantine Church.

For example, if a person dies who is not under the care of a physician in all 50-states their death is referred to the local coroner.    If Veterans who were not receiving care from private physicians were creating coroner's cases in large numbers that would be widely reported.  It is not.

With a few obvious exceptions, such as the hunting example you mentioned, it doesn\u2019t really matter what role is assigned to which sex.  The important thing is that they're a binary opposition.

In the US and Europe, the harm done to women may not equal the harm done to those who are not white, harm that comes to them because of their skin tone. But the harm exists. The RCC sets the example for all christianity - and the example it sets is that treating women as second-class is OK.  I too left the RCC, and now attend an Episcopal church, one with a female priest, as well as a male priest. There I see true complementarity in the church, in the liturgy, in the homilies, the living example of what God tells us is God's nature - God made them male AND female in GOD'S image.

Again , putting fish's tender feelings ahead of practicing to keep humans alive.  The sound of all these jets zooming around is the sound of freedom at work.

Just like land agriculture, the need is to grow the most food, sustainably, with the least burden to the planet.  That means fish that are capable of turning food into fish flesh most efficiently, raised in operations that consume the least resources and generate the least pollution.\n\nIf butterfish farming can meet those criteria, fine.

Gates didn't mention that and I don't really know it: were the slaves and free of First Nations enumerated by the US Census? I mean, they weren't really considered citizens. Did they count towards electoral votes and seats in Congress? \n\nFrom what I've seen, even the question of how many black folks were owned, under terms of US law, by The Civilized Tribes, is really vague and vexed. \"As many as 10,000 at times\" is what I've seen although I'm not sure where.

Jews and Muslims had to convert or die during the Inquisition.\n\nHave you heard of the Mughal Emperor Akbar? Probably not. He was the richest emperor in the world from 1558 to 1605 (his contemporary, Queen Elizabeth 1 of England, was poorer than any of his provincial governors). He was very tolerant, and encouraged religious debates to find the best in all religions. In comparison, Elizabeth was a religious fanatic.\n\nThe problem that I see is you think you know all about Islam by watching a couple of Hollywood movies and maybe a documentary or two.

Therefore the author of the Constitutions calls it a heathenish practice to ordain women priests,\u2026.for the Christian law allowed no such custom.  Some heretics, indeed, as Tertullian (Constit. Apost. Lib. Iii, c. 9) observes, allowed women to teach and exercise and administer baptism; but all this, he says, was against the rule (Tertul. De Praescript.

Read a really good book about two decades ago where the author tried to explain why there are cultural differences between our races.  He basically boiled it down to location.  Races that lived in the more moderate or tropical climates had many means of accessing food and the challenges by the weather for shelter was minimal.  The necessity for technology was minimized.  Cultures in climates farther away from the equator had to not only fight for resource but also develop technologies to advance in the harsher conditions.  Seemed pretty interesting.  It certainly doesn't mean someone from an equatorial climate couldn't successfully enter the more technological environment.  But, there isn't as much necessity for it.\n\nTrump's an idiot in many ways, with or without racist behavior.",

If they said no, they were sent back to different Churches to minister to more children. After all, we know priests would never lie. Perhaps the pope could send out a questionnaire with regard to homosexuality. If a priest truthfully admitted to their same sex attraction, they could be laicized. If they lied, they would continue in good graces. I am a little confused though.If a priest is expected to be celebate,   what difference does their sexual orientation make.",

We were hopeful as he did very well with Chip's players and scheme, but it went downhill as they graduated and were not replaced with players of the same caliber, particularly at quarterback.  Defensive recruiting and coaching also suffered after Alioti left and was replaced in-house.  This year, inexperience and his bad play calling cost us games that we had to win, and losing created a downward spiral.  Helfrich is a wonderful person, but he just did not cut it as coach, on the field, staffing or recruiting, and it could be seen coming for more than a year.

If that is child abuse, then a modern family today that raises a child in an environment that leads to their boys to engage in sex acts with other men is guilty of child abuse.  What the vast majority of families try to do is \"pattern\" their children for sex with the opposite sex, but they don't realize that there are environmental factors that can prevent that patterning (apologies if I misuse your term) from being successful (e.g., absent fathers, overbearing moms, secular propaganda about homosexuality, sexualization of people in the media, etc...)",

It was only after the concentration camps were liberated, and the world suffered the full impact of what was done there, that the U.S. took a firm stand against Nazism.\nAs to President Trump not having issued a condemnation of white supremacist ideology, Rieder seems blind or deaf to the fact that the President did so. The fault is that the condemnation was not in his first public statement.\nThe Greatest Generation was indeed that; sacrificing lives, families, homes, rolling up sleeves, etc. However, it did not do so entirely of its own accord.

Why on earth would you presume that just because there are more women, that 1. they must surely be unqualified and 2. some more deserving male must surely have been passed over because of sexism?\n\nWake up!",

It was not until the year1827 that science demonstrated that the female has a 50/50% role in producing new functional human life. Before that date the female sexual apparatus was considered as nothing more than a handy natural incubator.

I would defer to your field experience.  I think that some of the preference for head shots may be due to spot lighting where the eye lights up and provides a clear target, whereas the body might not show as well at night...not sure on that point.  But, certainly ground shooting to head or chest clearly ranks above cage trap, transport and lethal injection.

Ever been to an AA meeting wherein the emphasis is on \"getting out of yourself\"? Anchorage \"Lost and Found Group\" comes to mind (1985--). Practicing altruism, or agape love over eros love, requires willingness  (and the wherewithal) that is, unfortunately, too often unrealistic (unless you're a monk in a monastery; 'The Brother's Karamazov').

And then you break up and they are off to find another woman who will put up with the poor treatment.

Where humans everywhere believed that the natural world was animated by unseen spirits, a few ancient Greeks stumbled upon the idea that unseen spirits had created rules by which nature operates.

Paul was clear - demand his immediate repentance (which would requiring stopping the sexual activity or be put out of the church). In 2Corinthians, we learn that the man did repent and the church was now judgmentally refusing to allow his return. Paul corrected them again. The sin had stopped, he should be let back in and the sin should never be mentioned again. 1Corinthians also makes it clear that Christians must judge their fellow church members' lifestyles to assure the church doesn't violate God's standards, but we're not responsible for the rest of the world. Let the dead take care of the dead. Christians must discipline the church.\n\nI'll explain the rest in another post.",

Pro-gays demand all the rights and privileges but deny any accountability. Part of the accountability is acknowledging there are people who don't agree with homosexuality. In summer 2012, a gay Nebraska woman called the cops and said she was assaulted in her home because she was gay. Investigation showed the injuries were self-inflicted. Pro-gay people in the area were asked about the incident and they said very, very little, because they knew the woman hurt their image.

For those of you without real knowledge, he was part of the team that developed Transistors while working at Bell Labs. Later on, he got into Genetics and pushed the idea that minorities, low intelligence, etc were taking over the world and this had to be addressed (of course, more than a few would argue that Trump and W tend to make his point).  Needless to say that this did NOT go over well with most on Campus. HUGE protests, but nobody would block him from speaking.

Ladies, I'd say your strategy has been about as successful as the 'war on drugs'. Maybe it's time to address some baser realities, like maybe \"It's never your fault\" isn't such a good slogan. The definition of \"fault\" is multi-faceted and one of the possible definitions is \"an error\" as in: an error in judgment. An example of this would be getting stoned, bombed, whatever around a bunch partying of college frat boys. Another would be jogging, alone, in a park,  at night, wearing headphones(or some combination of these descriptors). We used to call not doing said things... common sense.

Few jurisdictions...none that I know of..share your perspective.  You refer to women who take grevious offense at unwanted touching (groping) as whinners and suggest such groping is \"inconsequential.\"  You really seem to suggest that women should just be \"better sports\" about receiving unwanted sexual advances (short of rape, of course) and not get so (to use your phrase) \"pissed off\" about it.

But I had scat from feral and owned dogs and cats in my yard as well as dogs pissing on my tires. I smacked a neighbors dog with a shovel that was being aggressive and not letting me on my own porch. To me owned and feral are a lot alike in that a lot of people don't take care of their pets. When it's crapping in my driveway I don't care if it is owned or feral. Feral cats were some ones pet at one time. How did they become feral?",

To say that a person cannot understand native culture because they are not native is racist, arrogant, bigoted and ignorant. Sadly, your own young people know less about their culture then they should and they have largely rejected it in favor of alcohol and iPhones. I am assuming you will blame the westerners and the whites for this as well. If you point the finger at others and call them bigots you should make sure that you are not that very thing first.

Mrs. Clinton has said \"She doesn't remember,\" and gets to skate because of a corrupt federal government. Hillary Clinton also lied to the families of those who were killed in Benghazi, including a US Ambassador. Clinton and the administration knew it was an organized Al-Qaeda attack (on September 11, 2012! Imagine that!) but claimed to America and the families some obscure YouTube video triggered angry Muslims. The Middle East is aflame today because of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, threatening the security of the US and our allies.

The context of sex is the tough one, not the sex acts. Who goes to the Church for understanding sex acts? \n\n\nWho knows the ways of people to use and exploit, to love and hold up, to gossip and dismiss, for instance, much less discussed topics. The Church has never tried to talk so much about anything else as it does about sex, and some subjects well deserve more attention. And why on earth or in heaven would women turn to the Church?

It can't refer to the number of travelers to the US from the 7 mostly Muslim countries in the ban--that would require about 100 full flights from each of the countries.\n\nThe link you sent echoes my concern that the ban will have much wider effects than your post indicated.  In fact, a caption for one of the videos says that 6 Syrian nationals in Philadelphia were detained and denied entry, which indicates your assertion that only 1 or 2 were denied entry is too low.",

There was barely ANY mention of the very rich Hawaiian history of the Ewa Plain and Honouliuli. In fact the HART Rail plans to focus on Japanese Internment as the primary historic feature of West Oahu, Ewa Honouliuli. It's the victimizing of Japanese thats the history feature...\n.\nThen as we move to Waipahu, there isn't any mention of the plantation era, ranches, numerous springs, shark goddess, it's Quonset Hut 33 where apparently a few black sailors\nwere involved in the \"Honolulu Race Riots\" of WW-II.  A small footnote in WW-II history because the CENTRAL FOCUS of HART Rail Station \"history\" - more VICTIMS of RACISM is what rail rider tourists will learn. \n.\nThe few Hawaiians attending the meeting asked why there was little IF ANY stories about Hawaiians - particularly positive stories of people, places. Hawaiian history NOT important,\nespecially good stuff",

Be wary of those who profess a hatred of guns, whatever their reason(s) may be!!!!

Read a really good book about two decades ago where the author tried to explain why there are cultural differences between our races.  He basically boiled it down to location.  Races that lived in the more moderate or tropical climates had many means of accessing food and the challenges by the weather for shelter was minimal.  The necessity for technology was minimized.  Cultures in climates farther away from the equator had to not only fight for resource but also develop technologies to advance in the harsher conditions.  Seemed pretty interesting.

Evidence/science based ways of knowing are far superior.   And while they don't guarantee immediate peace and prosperity, they most certainly give us the best chance for it.  That's why institutions in our society responsible for seeking the truth like the press, the courts, and universities, use evidence-based ways of knowing and long ago left behind the great engine of ignorance and stupidity known as religion.

But lets look at reality. The AMT tax impacted very few people when it was introduced. But it now impacts much of the middle class due to inflation. So don't believe the lies that this corrupt Congress is pushing. Most of the middle class will be paying a lot higher taxes in eight years if this lame bill passes.\n\nAnd that higher standard deduction is a joke for families. You pay more in taxes as soon as you have three or more children because the Republicans take away the deduction for dependents.\n\nThe Democrats are stupid and Republicans are stupid as well.

The short shrift with which Francis has dealt with Cardinals Burke, Ca\u00f1izares, M\u00fcller and Sarah must have struck fear in many members of the Curia and among bishops throughout the world. Perhaps the hierarchy are waiting to see which way the cookie crumbles, a cowardly stance when you think about it.\nWhen the walls start to fall in on him Pope Francis may opt for the way out his predecessor opened for him.\nWere he to do so, I can't imagine the College of Cardinals will make the same mistake again.",

Some for the better - much of the Biblically prescribed conduct would be found repugnant and amount to criminal acts in today's world.  It's just another version of Shari'ah.\n\nIn Matthew 22:36-40, Jesus was asked which of the commandments were the greatest. He responded that  the greatest is to love the Lord with all our heart, soul, and minds. The second, He says is like it - to love our neighbor as we love ourselves. Jesus adds that all Christian law is based on these two principles.\n\nYes, Jesus's message has been lost, and modern \"Christians\" have become very unlike their Christ.

Because the Hawaii US Attorney's office had prosecuted the uncle on what looked like false information, the office DQ'd itself from the investigation where the uncle would be a witness against HPD.  A very experienced federal prosecutor -- 25+ years -- from San Diego was assigned to work with the FBI.\n8.  Mr. Silvert sent his evidence of the frame job to the Police Commission, who proceeded to assert their \"Deaf, Dumb, and Blind\" rights to do nothing. \n9.  The FBI started interviewing people.\nMore next post.",

Yet the majority of our legislators have given in, once again, to the loud minority who oppose traffic cams for whatever reason. Shame on them. Let's hope that SB-221 comes up again and again until it's finally passed.\n\nIts purpose is not only to punish lawbreakers. It also serves as a deterrent. Just knowing that the cameras are there will force potential lawbreakers to think twice. No one needs to be reminded that a car is a dangerous 2-ton weapon. \n\nThe old law wasn't perfect. The new won't be perfect when (not IF) it is passed. But we can fix that. The next time we read about a traffic death or injury, let's ask ourselves if a camera might have prevented it.",

Add those to the nearly 150,000 resident licenses. This is an economic engine that keeps growing and that 10 years ago contributed nearly 2 billion economic impact for Alaska. It is likely that it it exceeds 3 billion today. It's hard on commercial fishers, but times have changed and the time when they had the resource pretty much to themselves is over. Much of the money coming from Commercial Fishing leaves the state, yet is erroneously counted in calculating benefit to the state. On the other hand most of the money generated by sports fishing stays in the state and the economic multiplier is very significant.\nIt is time for ADF&G and the Fish Board to capitalize on this opportunity.",

Later on, he got into Genetics and pushed the idea that minorities, low intelligence, etc were taking over the world and this had to be addressed (of course, more than a few would argue that Trump and W tend to make his point).  Needless to say that this did NOT go over well with most on Campus. HUGE protests, but nobody would block him from speaking.

It seems that the judge does find there was sexual activity in the cabbie taking her pants off, but he acquits only because there was no proof that the complainant didn't consent.

There is no contradiction. Of course our society and culture has religious origins, respecting those origins doesn't mean we aren't secular now. Just as our society has features based on paganism, others based on Roman or Greek origins, it doesn't mean we are either pagan, Greek or Roman now. \n\nYou don't need to tear down Notre Dame or the Blue Mosque to be secular.",

Being a Christian has always been the best way but one which has always been filled with persecution and it always will be.

I have regrets for that period of my life.   Truthfully, I wished I had waited.  Not due to shame so much for the sex but more I wish I had been strong enough with God that I didn't let the hurt pull me so far away from His Holy Spirit.  I don't think God demands we seek sex in marriage only for reproduction as Christ never gives this reason and even St. Paul never recommends people marry to have children at all but instead so they (both men and women) don't fall into sin due to some of them not being able to handle a life without sex.

All priests are ordained with certain vows that they have considered and prayed over for years in preparation. Hence, they are not \"forced not to have sex.\" Assent to priestly vows is a choice before God. It would make just as little sense to alter the vow of celibacy to accommodate the prevailing current of sexualization as it would to alter the vows of poverty or obedience to accommodate the prevailing currents of materialism and license. Jesus is the model upon which the priest is ordered, and Jesus is eternal.",

In turn a significant amount of government overhead on green funding programs is eliminated, so that markets are left to come up with solutions given the tax signals. \n\nTrudeau's approach layers carbon tax on top of existing green programs, and of course his additional intervention and spending.

Both the Jewish temple and pagan temples were understood as the place where God lived. Early Christians had a clear choice for conceiving their buildings as gathering places (synagogues) or as replacements for the Temple in Jerusalem. They chose gathering places.\n\nThe PRIMARY focus on the Eucharist as an object of adoration, as the centre piece in a Temple--instead of the \"glory\" of Yahweh or instead of  a pagan idol --displaced the scriptural notion of the Eucharist as food in the middle ages precisely at the time the faithful we told they were not worthy to receive the sacred food and began not receiving communion almost all of the time they attended mass. Their \"consolation prize\" was the opportunity to adore the sacred host and chalice as they were elevated at mass; and the opportunity to worship the Eucharist in a tabernacle whenever they visited a church.",

Coal has a lot.\nExternal costs are by definition not included in the up front price of a product or service. This makes the price artificially low, leading to an inefficient market. Changing the free market price point by shifting some of the costs for others to pay means it is not pure capitalism. I think this moves it more toward socialism, like a tax.\nIronically, many socialist countries understand this. In some cases, we understand this too. Taxes are high on cigarettes in part because they cause health problems that cost us all. Same with second-hand smoke.\nBurning coal produces the ultimate second-hand smoke. I cannot understand why a free-market capitalist does not call for the price of coal to include these external costs. Could it be they don't care about capitalism, just getting more for themselves at the cost to others?",

Pro-gays demand all the rights and privileges but deny any accountability. Part of the accountability is acknowledging there are people who don't agree with homosexuality. In summer 2012, a gay Nebraska woman called the cops and said she was assaulted in her home because she was gay. Investigation showed the injuries were self-inflicted. Pro-gay people in the area were asked about the incident and they said very, very little, because they knew the woman hurt their image.

One was not retaliation even though the US had been involved in attacking Muslims since at least 1947 in Palestine. \n\nAnd now Canada, killing Muslims in Afghanistan since 2002, does not mention retaliation as a reason for the killing of Canadian soldiers. The attack on Parliament Hill was an even more obvious case of retaliation. Parliament Hill was where our troops were ordered to kill in Afghanistan. Clearly retaliation.\n\nInstead the killing of Canadian soldiers \u201cwas inspired by the Islamic State.\u201d How American that statement is.",

I have confirmed with friends who still work there that older, moribund Veterans still apply for care.  I am a very informed commentator.  For example, if a person dies who is not under the care of a physician in all 50-states their death is referred to the local coroner.    If Veterans who were not receiving care from private physicians were creating coroner's cases in large numbers that would be widely reported.  It is not.  I cited, briefly, one example of the current Secretary's success.  Ask the caseworkers locally at the St. Vincent de Paul Society who are working with VA to get homeless Veterans and their families off the streets.

For many centuries, marriage was a business contract between two families; love wasn't part of the equation.  Moreover, women were treated like property.  A woman had to submit to her husband.  It wasn't until the 1870s that abuse was considered a crime.  We didn't start seriously prosecuting it in the US until the 1970s.  Marital rape didn't exist as a crime until well into the 20th century.  A woman in the 1950s probably had little recourse when dealing with an abusive husband; now she has many more options.",

The International Atomic Energy Agency sealed and placed surveillance equipment on NK\u2019s nuclear power plants.  NK violated the agreement in December 2002 by cutting off the locks and disrupting surveillance equipment.

More out there now.\n\n But having fun having sex with someone you might not make pregnant (which was your joke, right?) does not equal masturbation. Well, not usually.",

From the inside looking out, I can't see myself, just as they couldn't see themselves.  It was this attitude that made us compatible co-workers.  In fact, this essay had me to consciously recall my former co-workers, to recall what they even looked like to see if they fit the label of \"ethnically diverse\".\n\nI suggest that this author try to wind back the clock to the 4-year age and start over.

I'm going to get jumped on for this, but from what research I've seen on the subject (admittedly, not a lot as it's not a subject of great interest to me), there seems to be more evidence pointing to such a connection than evidence pointing to a 'gay' gene.  That of course ain't sayin' much, as there is basically NO empirical evidence supporting the existence of a gay gene.  None.

If people knew they could be fined $50,000.00 for texting while they drive, regardless of whether or not they hurt anyone, I'm guessing that would keep their eyes off their phones.",

That one seems to get skirted a lot, especially by Catholics. \n\nIt can be difficult to determine what is actually being commanded. Many biblical scholars agree that the proscription on killing would be better read as \"murder\" and that killing an adjacent tribe-member was not breaking a commandment. \n\nThe \"coveting\" of the things around us, as mentioned in another commandment, is a tremendous incentive for many people to better themselves. We could argue that possessions are bad and that we should all live in squalor but the point is that being a good person, as you seem to be, you filter the rules of this particular religious tradition through your sensibilities, which is a good thing.\n\nHow would you feel about making your own list of commandments? It'd be interesting to see how they align with other Decalogues. I'm fond of this one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKroMZN9gEo\n\nCheers.",

No one deserves it. God does not want it for women does not mean women are less than men. Also, the Jesuits pay these men's tuition because, obviously, they're Jesuits.They have given their lives to the Jesuits and will payback with their lives.The old takes care of the young, etc.Pretty simple.Also, donors give to the formation of seminarians because they believe in the calling, they love the work that Jesuits do.

Of course, much of the opposition to gay marriage today seems more cultural/group affirming than moral analysis.  Decent moral analysis has to do with the question scripturalists evade - were gays born/created that way?  The CDF letter (not even an encyclical) said gays were disordered (a natural law sophistry, not a scriptural term) because we were all getting too close to allowing gay marriage, which would damage the Catholic brand and become inconvenient for those who blame child sex abuse on gays.

Theologically it is an opening for parrhesia- free speech - and if adhered to -which is a big \"if\"- which will non-violently change things. \nHowever, he seem to be surrounded by a legion of veterans left over from the Wojtyla-Ratzinger years  who have self-liturgized as inviolable objects of human respect, and who themselves fear nothing more than this very parrhesia. That's Francis' principal frustration. \nBut hey, Wojtyla and Ratzinger's  main social achievement was to preside over the decline of Catholicism in it a birth place -Europe.

They are a Catholic university.  The Catholic Church does not condone things like gay marriage. \n\nBut my response was that the \"Catholic\" universities like Notre Dame would not permit a person to speak in defense of traditional marriage and Catholic teaching--ironically at a university that calls itself Catholic!

We're one fairly variable 'race'.  Pretty much a consensus among both anthropologists and geneticists.\n\nTake any set of characters you deem 'racially diagnostic'--length of nasal passages, lung capacity, limb proportions, number of bones in the ankle--for example Scandinavians.  I'll find you another population--example Andean \"Indians\"--which doesn't look anything like the first, but in whom the above-specified characters fall in the same range.\n\nWe all went through a genetic bottleneck tens of thousands of years ago.

The Church is horribly deficient in updating its understanding  of it, has danced around the issues while modern science has increased out knowledge of humans and sex by the hundredfold.  Ignorance hurts way too many to be allowed to just continue because some clerics are frightened of what it might reveal (including about ordained life) and what it might lead to.  This is theology in pursuit of safety, not of God.  God's Creation is so much more calmly diverse and inclusive, and if the Church is to tear down its self-made divisions between believers in Christ, then it needs to open the window on all of the issues you mention for some fresh air per St. John XXIII.",

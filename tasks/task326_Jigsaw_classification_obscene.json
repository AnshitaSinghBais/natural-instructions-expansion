Because forcing someone to \"respect\" the flag and stand is now considered patriotic in the land of the free and home of the brave. Even if you don't feel you have the same rights as everyone else. It seems being forced to stand certainly reinforces the idea that you don't have the same rights and your voice must be silenced. This is a really difficult concept but, Black lives actually do matter, in the same way other lives matter. Black opinions matter. The players give them that voice? Why take away their rights?",

McCain has waxed and waned, but the trajectory of his career has always leaned toward integrity and courage; we need that from him now more than ever. Romney spoke the truth about Trump during the campaign, and then groveled to him in hope of becoming Secretary of State. He'd have been a good one, and I even believe that it was the desire to serve honorably that caused him to grovel to Trump. It was, however, a horrendous mistake. Trump neutralized him, neutered him, emasculated him -- invited him to dinner and served him his own testicles.

North Korea has threatened the South with a firestorm of Seoul, which is about 30 miles from the North's artillery, probably just out of range.  So that threat has been debunked.  I believe the North realizes this and with nukes on IRBM's, wants to develop a credible deterrent to an invasion by the South.  Would the North use them?  They would be suicidal to do so, and I believe the North wants primarily to shore up the stalemate between the two governments.  China perhaps sees this as mostly a show of force.  \n\nAny embargo would hurt only the everyday Koreans, who in past hard times have eaten grass soup to survive, while thousands starved to death.

Third, going back to the OP's post and using that to rif on a favorite conservative position - As it is prudent to assume that all 'others' are looking to rob, kill, or rape us it is thus only prudent to carry a gun everywhere, why is it not prudent in the face of our possible (though, really the data clearly points to our complicity in accelerating climate change) involvement in accelerating climate change to take actions to prevent or combat, much like feeling the need to carry a weapon to prevent or combat a theoretical attack?",

When the home is paid for, your fixed costs greatly reduce, where the renter continues to pay yearly rent increases for life.  In my experience of owning rental units for over 30 years I know of a small percentage of occupants who invest beyond there rent, because many renters like the freedom and no responsibility of maintaning a home, and use the money for travel and entertainment much more that the homeowner.

To me, if someone wants to kill, they will find a way.....drive a car into a crowd, plant a bomb, etc.  In a recent news story out of Japan, probably the most anti-gun ownership country, a man was arrested for having nine dismembered bodies in his apartment.

Wars create horrible conditions which cause people to resort to often unthinkable means to survive.  For many women, it was the use of their bodies, and there usually was more supply than demand.  I personally witness this during the Korean War and during two years in Vietnam.  Some members of the Imperial Japanese forces no doubt forced women to have sex, which, of course, is rape, but I believe the \u201ccomfort women\u201d who served the Imperial Japanese forces in brothels that sprung up and operated near Japanese bases did so voluntarily for pay.",

Also, the STASI and the Soviets knew that those weapons would have been employed against a) the Soviet military advisers, b) the Cuban brigades and c) the MPLA allies in Angola. My guess is that STASI contacted the Cubans and the Cubans conspired with Noriega to seize the freight. I wouldn't be surprised if Noriega then sold the cargo to the CIA. Everyone benefited from the deal, only the Boers got fucked.",

America is a society that foster's labeling of citizens as valuable or not valuable.  Felons are ostracized for life without a second thought.  People are thrown away in life sentences for offenses less than premeditated murder.  People are placed on sex offender lists for life without recourse.  The prison actions simply reflect the American view that there are good people and bad people and that the latter can be discarded without consequence, care, or compassion.  Trouble is, we teach that respect for life is not universal and thus each individual can frame groups that do not matter and kill them.  The only way to really end the killing is to teach universal respect for our fellows.  Things like prison remain necessary when reform fails, but the routine dumping of life as having no value, is a great teacher, and we pay dearly in terms of consequence.",

Funny how history repeats itself but hopefully the outcome will be much different this time around. I'm not certain Pax will \"get at least\" 20 games to prove himself. If he starts as well as Trevor did, then you may be right but if he stinks it up, it may be 10 or less. Keep in mind that Pax has had 2 full TCs to win the job against a 7th round pick and failed, plus he had 2 starts in 2016, so he has at least 1 strike, maybe 2 against him. If this were Lynch's first season with the team, I'd agree with your logic but I believe his leash will be shorter - especially since it is also tethering the new coaches and possibly higher.",

His appeal was denied by the Hawaii Supreme Court on July 20, 2004.\nSai has been spouting his \"if this then that\" theory for years. The basic premise is just as silly as saying that  the American Revolution was \"illegal\" (in the eyes of the King of England). Therefore, the entire East Coast of the United States today is still owned by England. And, that everything that has gone on since is \"illegal\".

It's not. His hyperbole is for him; he can't tolerate the prospect of even the slightest admission of a personal deficiency or area for improvement.\nLastly, with respect to his inability to project empathy, it's far more likely that he is incapable of actually feeling empathy.

If slavery could be eliminated and the slaves returned to \"their long-lost fatherland,\" claimed Lincoln, \"it will indeed be a glorious consummation.\"\n\n\"When Douglas tried to portray Lincoln as the friend of the blacks, Lincoln countered, as he did in a speech at Peoria, Illinois, by denying that he saw blacks as equals and by advocating the colonization of freed slaves in Liberia. Lincoln was aware, however, of the practical difficulties of such a program: \"If they were all landed there [Liberia] in a day, they would all perish in the next ten days,\" he stated.\"",

Today, 42 percent of children in the US are born to single mothers. The children and their mothers have very difficult lives. Teenage pregnancies in the US and Canada are far above European rates. One of the best ways for a man to make a woman's life miserable for decades is to impregnate her and leave.

Then why didn't the DA frame the charges against Zille purely as such, and NOT as Mmusi Maimane did, ie Zille defended colonialism and apartheid and, therefore, she's a racist or 'bigot' (as Mckaiser wanted him to admit), forcing her to defend herself against an unjust charge (see http://www.politicsweb.co.za/opinion/the-madness-of-the-da)? Who is more arrogant and egotistic, Zille or her accusers?",

The best course of treatment is to use it and drug treatment(one on one counseling and group counseling) which can all be out patient.\nBy the way, suboxone is covered by Medicaid and most private insurances.\nCombine it with trained medical people to administer and monitor.\nVivitrol has been more on the rise by jails because it is injected. It has had some success with alcoholics. \nBut Suboxone can be misused unless it is given once a day (visiting nurse or at a clinic) until the person is doing well enough to be given prescription.\nI think the big Pharma, if smart would offer all the treatment meds but naltrexone for free.\nBut they won\u2019t be that smart and the greedy sob\u2019s will need to get their fannys sued.",

Murkowski shut it down in a economic down cycle to grab its money cache.  What passes for 'Venture Capital' only goes for proven ideas with a clear & strong marketing plan ~ the sure things that the wealthy elite can extract a big share of the profits from the inventor.\nMaybe i am just not good at either meeting billionaires or put them off, the truly wealthy sometimes are incredibly charitable though usually, Eldon Musk, works in his own house funding long term payoff ideas even.

In substance if not degree, they each believe they are above the law and exempt from constitutional constraint.

One motivated by ideology; the other by avarice. \n\nOur dalliance with autocratic rule never plumbed the depths of the abyss now enveloping America - in part because Harper was no Trump and in part because it would never have been tolerated by Canadians and Canadian institutions.

Courts have ruled they are implicit contracts. What's readily apparent is you have no idea what union reps do, All collectivebargaining agreements have explicut management rights clause. Like management has the right to direct the workforce. Unions specifically don't have comanagement rights. Like how to clean toilets. What stands out in the article above is how the Hawaii public worker collective bargaining law rules out any negotiations on working conditions. A standard feature of pretty much all collective bargaining agreements. An example, AC in the schools. When you get to the heat levels in some of Hawaii classrooms it becomes a health and safety issue. Yet teachers could niether file a grievance, nor even negotiate it. Management currently has the absolute right to tell employees how to clean restrooms. So why is management doing such a shitty job now.",

All you need for terror attacks is a threshold number of Muslims in a population.

The solution for Western, primarily Christian countries is obvious - keep the number of Muslims entering the country to a minimum and avoid encouraging large communities of Muslims. Sound immigration policy is required which involves ensuring that Muslim immigrants have adequate English/French ability, a skill that is in demand and a background free of problem behaviour.

Subsequently, the diocese embarked on a fundraising campaign - wait for it: apparently, the diocese had spent upwards of $60 million of the cathedral funds settling sexual abuse cases.\n\nBesides, the clerics are clueless that the design of their new cathedral actually images female genitalia - nothing wrong with that especially since most great European cathedrals traditionally were built to be representations of \"the womb of God.\"",

SOLUTION:  Gather all the people of Afghanistan in one place and kill them all with Assad's chemical weapons, and nuke the country with IRAN's nuclear weapons, and be done with it.  All the terrorists in Afghanistan will be dead, all the untrustworthy Afghans will be dead and the land will not be inhabitable for years to come, so no more worry about safe havens for the Taliban or ISIS.  I think this solution can also apply to NK.  I hope POTUS sees my post.  I think he might consider it as an ideal plan to handle these two problem nations.  It is a highly feasible plan with minimum cost of lives to the US.  Thinking outside of the box!!!!!",

(I say expertly because no country has had more experience at the deception.) Even though the NY Times yesterday published an interview with the Iraqi commander who called in the airstrike, and who bemoaned the loss of life in the collapsed buildings, now we hear a conflicting story. True, the story doesn't make any sense, but that doesn't matter. The goal is to sow doubt in the minds of the public about what happened, so that they give the US military the benefit of the doubt rather than believe it committed a war crime. And before long, some other account of civilian deaths will come along to displace this one in the news. And then the cycle of deception will start all over again.",

Muslims coming to Sweden almost immediately get on welfare, continue to work the system with multiple wives collecting while having children, and they remain there as they have zero skills, but more importantly, they aren't interested in learning skills - their husbands don't want them to learn anything. Sweden's biggest challenge will be how they handle the upcoming liberal-muslim conflict over Sweden's traditional liberal agenda, or, the inevitable Muslim male pressure to formally adopt Sharia Law after years of surreptiously running it without government approval.

On average black people, who comprise just more than 10% of the population, whose drug use is half that of whites, are arrested three times as often on drug charges as whites. So, the higher rate of drug use in the Caucasian population that outnumbers the minority population by almost ten to one, means that black people are arrested on drug charges at a rate of 20 times that of white people for the same offense.

In your case, it looks like a moderator at ADN chose to restrict your account, possibly because of the most recent comment you've had deleted, \"Shit for brains is too kind.\" \nOther than that though, I can't speak to the exact reason an ADN moderator restricted you.

Tie a tax break to increasing worker salaries, if that is what he is saying is one of the real purposes of tax reform. Why wouldn't he? Because.. it's really just about making his rich friends richer. To hell with the workers. They are big expenses, and can be replaced by automation, or workers overseas. BTW... Why are Trump's products still made overseas? Why doesn't Toomey suggest to his friend Trump, \"Open a men's clothing factory\" in PA? That way, Trump's \"best company the world has ever seen\" can set a good example, and create jobs.",

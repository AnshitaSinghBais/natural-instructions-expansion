You forced the Gang Task Force to be eliminated and put a moratorium on related training, dropping SWAT is 1/2 of the staff it used to be. Burglary became a Patrol Officer job, not for Detectitives - eg: No Followup. \n\nAPD was purposely understaffed during your tenure - 408 officers dropped to 320.

Blacks sell to people they don't know and in public, which makes them vastly easier to arrest.\"\n\nBlacks arrested for drugs are more likely to be sent to jail because they're more likely to have had a previous run-in with the law. Police tend to patrol high-crime areas more aggressively, which tend to be the poor areas, which have a higher proportion of minorities. Thus, they're more likely to be stopped for something and have a rap sheet once a drug charge comes along.\"\n\nhttp://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2016/jul/13/van-jones/van-jones-claim-drug-use-imprisonment-rates-blacks/",

The blind sheik who was behind the first Trade Tower bombing in 1994 or so was indicted, tried and convicted in US Federal court and is now serving time somewhere \"up the river\". Our system worked under Clinton but then the Bush administration decided to break with all tradition by using torture, rendition to torture centers and military tribunals to deal with anyone even suspected of wrongdoing. Trump is using and building on that illegal policy. President Obama tried to close the prison and has released many of the suspects who have been held without charges let alone trial for 15 years.",

Jones doesn't need to have a light 'shined' on him.   He has his own multimedia platform to spew his brand of venom and millions of follower.

My theory and it's biased,  because I hate police and have for a long time, is that he called the police to tell them this asshole was beating the shit out of his girlfriend and he, being a concealed weapons holder,  waited outside for the police to arrive with his weapon and then when they arrived instead of deescalating the situation probably shouted \"DROP THE GUN, DROP THE GUN~bam bam bam bam bam bam bam.  Seven shots.  Senseless.  The only conclusion I can come to is the fucking EPD dropped the ball again and shot another minority because that's what they do.  They are nothing but brutish punks who deserve every  bad thing that happens to them when they fuck up.  In this case I hope they fire the pieces of shit who must have \"feared for their lives\" .",

I've had a look at your account, and to be quite honest I'm not sure of the reason for your restriction! I do know however, that your restriction doesn't have to do with other users choosing to flag your comments--even if a large number of your comments are flagged (for good reason or not), it is still up to a moderator in the end to decide what to do with them. In your case, it looks like a moderator at ADN chose to restrict your account, possibly because of the most recent comment you've had deleted, \"Shit for brains is too kind.\" \nOther than that though, I can't speak to the exact reason an ADN moderator restricted you. However, the restriction should be lifted tomorrow, Jan. 14th!\nThanks,\nEmily",

After all, since the terms \"fuck you\" and \"fuck you assholes\" have, within my lifetime, been transformed from perhaps the worst things we could say to each other to now totally defanged and democratized parts of everyday speech, how can it be that vertically extending one's middle finger should be \"saved\" for life-threatening experiences--as if that was still the case even 50 years ago?  The gesture, and its current meaning, date to at least the Roman Empire.  So it seems we should now know MANY things are more offensive--such as war!",

The \"learning curve\" being one. As you are probably well aware from the reports of the various Judicial Reviews here in Ireland; the repeated phrase of many bishops & superiors; was that they had no awareness; it was all new to them; they had no training; they were never prepared for such scandal; nobody told them etc. These were the men with PhDs in various disciplines. The best and the brightest, that got the tap on the shoulder. They were the \"good shepherds\", who would look after \"their flocks\". Good shepherds would not leave their flocks vulnerable to predators.\n \"Lies; lies and damn lies\" . \nYour synopsis is very revealing and opens up another path to understanding this critical failure by the institutional church.

She demonstrates mettle and fortitude throughout the entire movie; she displays constant resistance to an infantilizing and sexually imposing predator, and, finally, the choice she makes in the final scene while listening to the radio (no spoiler, I hope).  Not to mention some serious badassary (sp?)!   There are cliches no doubt: a line or two like \"You've got to be kidding me,\" a sophisticate and a country bumpkin bond, and when the violence gets going some impossibly close calls, but cliches are sort of requisite in thrillers.  What we didn't see in this movie, and we normally expect from this genre, is an exploitation of women and their bodies, an agentless female with, at best, a trick or two up her sleeve, or even--and holy crap!--any sex at all.  Awesome movie, which one did you watch?",

This is the old Kipling concept that white man like him, must take care of the poor natives who cannot take care of themselves. Bit old fashioned however gallant, Mr. Wohlforth. Nearly all native inmates I encountered at ACC West, knew wholly that they did wrong. Funny thing about native people are that they are extremely honest folks, even when they did wrong. More then any other ethnic groups I have run into, including my fellow Asian Americans, native people stand out in their honesty in acknowledging that they did wrong. Few who claims innocence, are those coming in from probation violations and some of them got just cause to be unhappy, being violated for petty violations. Maybe that is where Mr. Wohlforth should take a look at.",

In the interest of Church unity, he seems to feel confusion is better than clarity.\n\nThe truth is Francis isn't going to preserve the Church in the West with confusion about doctrine the majority of laity have already settled for themselves.  He needs to decide if the Church's mission is better served by his version of sowing ambiguity for the sake of the Burke's of the Catholic world, or biting the bullet and moving beyond the authoritarianism and black and white dogma the Burke's of the Church need for their own security.  If Jesus is the example we should follow, the decision is pretty clear.  We move beyond authoritarianism and black and white dogma.",

Talk about standards. I'm holding CB to a higher standard and they didn't meet it with this one.",

The real question is why he wasn't fired much sooner. All that has followed as a consequence is only political gamesmanship.",

Also, states who enact legislation like this will see their educated workforce shrink, and many businesses will decide that they can't recruit the kind of workforce they need if they put their headquarters in a state with repressive laws. At the same time, nothing makes people get off the couch and vote for a Democrat more than busy body republican in your underpants restrictive policies.

Pot was a great reason to randomly stop and search minorities because until the 1960's they were the majority of pot smokers. The police have been known to plant it on people they want to harass. I saw such a video this week showing the Baltimore police doing just that. When the counter culture adopted pot for recreation the criminal justice system could use the same tool to attack the counter culture that was fighting the government over things like the Vietnam War and white racism. Sessions and his fellow travelers love this tool in the legal tool box to abuse their enemies. No one has died from an over dose of pot. Making pot a schedule 1 drug has nothing to do with public health or public safety. It is about controlling the public. They don't even want the medical benefits of pot to be known even though humans have been using it since the beginning of time.",

The Church is horribly deficient in updating its understanding  of it, has danced around the issues while modern science has increased out knowledge of humans and sex by the hundredfold.  Ignorance hurts way too many to be allowed to just continue because some clerics are frightened of what it might reveal (including about ordained life) and what it might lead to.  This is theology in pursuit of safety, not of God.  God's Creation is so much more calmly diverse and inclusive, and if the Church is to tear down its self-made divisions between believers in Christ, then it needs to open the window on all of the issues you mention for some fresh air per St. John XXIII.",

Regarding slavery,  this was not just an issue, but THE issue of the era, one so big we had to fight a horrible war over it-- and Deady was regarded  as the strongest pro-slavery voice in Oregon.  \nMoreover, he never admitted he had been wrong nor did he ever admit slavery was evil.  He continued his contempt  for those who regarded slavery as a moral issue all his life-- while the report listed two diary entrees, there were actually two others which revealed his lifelong sympathy for slavery.   \nI'd  add that while we should not judge historical figures by \"contemporary values\" I'd suggest there are universal values and that American slavery grossly violated them.\n\nHOWEVER-- In my view  President Schill is correct in weighing  this decision further, for on- balance, when considering the many admirable qualities Deady displayed, truly this is a tough call on a complex man.",

That's why every effort has been made to rein in Kim by international law, UN Resolutions & Sanctions, and pressuring China.\n\nThe view is that it is better to incur hundreds of thousands of casualties now rather than hundreds of millions of casualties later when Kim, Assad, and the Ayatollahs all have thermonuclear ICBMs derived from Kim's arsenal.\n\nE. Unlike Hussein, Kim definitely has hydrogen bombs, ICBMs, biological & chemical weapons; he is willing to sell these WMDs to other countries and terrorists; he has repeatedly threatened to use them against the Allies.",

But that's a different discussion for another time. The other purpose of the electoral college is to make sure that someone wholly unsuitable to be president does not get into office. \n\nIt's not about popular vote, it's not sore losing, is that people are fearful that Trump is not qualified to be president and is a threat to the USA.

It shows that the population is attuned to the issue and are not afraid to report as in other nations where sexual assault victims have something to lose in reporting and in some cases could themselves be accused of a crime as a result of being a victim of a sexual attack. It is only logical that if the legal definition of rape is broad and where the populace is not ashamed to report incidences of sexual assault that the rates would necessarily be higher irrespective of the ethnic make-up of the population.",

So, just because some seminary professors with letters after their names take a position, doesn't mean its right.

Come to think of it, saying so isn't really that far-fetched from reality as, while bazookas are regulated, grenade launchers and anti-tank weapons are legal. Go figure. My point is, whatever weapons one deems should be legalized or regulated, the line must be drawn somewhere, for if there is no line to cross, what would prevent one from purchasing a military tank.

This means that homosexually inclined priests are more likely to abuse children. This is not the same as saying that in general, homosexuals are more likely to be child abusers.\nIt seems to me that for homosexuals, becoming  a Catholic priest opens up opportunities to encounter teenage boys or before this scandal, did in the recent past, hardly a calling from God and thus justifying the ban.\nAny priest with homosexual inclinations who has remained celibate and not communicated his sexual preferences to all and sundry need not feel insulted in the slightest.

Today's rates and investment returns are nowhere near high enough to cover the pension payouts of public sector employees retiring on full pension in their 50's and living into their 80's. The massive shortfalls in public sector pension funding are being made up for by private sector tax payers who are themselves working longer and longer, many into their 70's, in order to retire. And remember, the average private sector employee does not even have a pension! Yet they are forced to pay through their nosew for the defined benefit pensions off the priveledged public sector class.

The previous Leftist administration - and indeed, the Democrats in general - have tried to transform basic American culture via mis-use of \"identity politics\"  and a globalist agenda that benefitted no one but the elites. More Americans than you realize want their country back and want the level playing field that Trump is offering, including increasing numbers of people from minority groups. I'm not hearing any hatred from the many Trump supporters I know. Only from the Leftists (many of whom are paid to disruptive and nasty). \n\nCanada has always prided itself on being a more \"civil\" country than the U.S. But I fear if Trudeau continues his deconstruction of core Canadian values, open border policy, the favouring of some religious groups over others and conspicuous spending, more of us will be tempted to be a bit less \"civil\".",

These views tend to exaggerate the benefits First Nations receive while underplaying the role our government and ancestors played in creating the present conditions.

Not due to shame so much for the sex but more I wish I had been strong enough with God that I didn't let the hurt pull me so far away from His Holy Spirit.  I don't think God demands we seek sex in marriage only for reproduction as Christ never gives this reason and even St. Paul never recommends people marry to have children at all but instead so they (both men and women) don't fall into sin due to some of them not being able to handle a life without sex.

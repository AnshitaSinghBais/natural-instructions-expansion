Yes, FAA should have a role, but the helicopter companies are seriously at fault for their overall bad behavior. They refuse to delineate routes, thus a pilot flies wherever they want. And some of these pilots are hot doggers who try to give the passengers a thrill. FAA just throws up its hands with the basic response that pilots can pretty much fly (and land) wherever they want, unless of course it is a military base where DOD can exercise powers above and beyond FAA. To argue that the disabled need a helicopter ride over a park is absurd, everybody can look at a video like the rest of us impoverished noise-impacted suffering resident fools.. How about a ride over Pohakuloa, it is pretty interesting, should we not all have access to overfly that area? Equal access for overfly!",

Germany has many socialist policies: healthcare, childcare and universal education in public schools, where their careers begin. Americans are not as advanced in their thinking; they do not grasp that, 'it takes a village'; they have never gotten over the Civil War; they are not into smart women--intelligent women still throw them off, and there is a possibility they do not believe in the equality of the sexes. Their education system is broken. It is sad that as a senior I will probably be long gone before we have equality of the sexes and even in my grand daughter's time there will be problems with this same issue.

And if Jews were being targeted and murdered, the government shouldn't condemn anti-Semitism. No matter how bad it gets against a specific group, you feel the government should just issue a bland statement against discrimination of any kind.\n\nI believe that's insufficient. When we see violence and hatred directed against gays we condemn violence and hatred towards gays, while denouncing discrimination in general. When we see Jews being targeted by violence and hatred we condemn violence and hatred against Jews, while denouncing all forms of discrimination.

As Christians we consider this to be a gift from God. Obviously Homosexuals have the same needs as heterosexuals for a loving sexual relationship, to impose celibacy upon any one, either a heterosexual or a homosexual person would create an intolerable situation within their heart, which would only serve to increase the desire for companionship and sexual intimacy...\n\nhttp://www.v2catholic.com/background/2015/07/2015-07-25Kevin-Walters-a-bond-of-Divine-Mercy.htm\n\nkevin your brother\nIn Christ",

My wife's brother in law refused to believe that it was a loan. He lied about his income on his mortage application and had to sell at a loss when he could not keep up payments. The sale got held up because lawyers found the lien for the government loan when they tried to transfer the title. He was so confident that it was a grant that he didn't track it as a a loan on his finances.\n\nIn contrast my wife and I didn't need the money, but since it was interest free we put it into term deposits, then got a 10% discount for early repayment.

This bill went through every committee and every vote unanimously.  As anyone following the legislature knows, this is extraordinary.  It is a bill that has literally saved lives and enabled victims to move forward with healthier lives, yet Munoz decided on the basis of one aggrieved dad who violated restraining orders to try to reverse 12 years of progress.

The country went from second richest in Latin America to second poorest (beating out Haiti) during Castro's half century dictatorship.  Even his early reforms in health care and education have largely run out of money and deteriorated drastically.  But the biggest three things Fidel did really badly for the average Cuban were breakfast, lunch and dinner.  Mind you, Cassie, not all Cubans suffered.  Fidel, for example, took them for some $900 million dollars, 20 mansions around the Caribbean and an 88 foot luxury yacht to die for.

Muslims coming to Sweden almost immediately get on welfare, continue to work the system with multiple wives collecting while having children, and they remain there as they have zero skills, but more importantly, they aren't interested in learning skills - their husbands don't want them to learn anything. Sweden's biggest challenge will be how they handle the upcoming liberal-muslim conflict over Sweden's traditional liberal agenda, or, the inevitable Muslim male pressure to formally adopt Sharia Law after years of surreptiously running it without government approval.

The compartmentalization pervades everything beyond mid-level management.\n\nSo, a woman can have smarts, but not the \"right kind\" of smarts for certain kinds of roles.   This is insidious and career development and training decisions reflect it.   This starts at lower levels, and ultimately becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy because the women don't have all the right training for senior roles in more technical areas before they reach the point of being serious contenders for senior roles.

People may know little or perhaps even know a great deal about Islam but, what the left wants to do is force you to like it.  The mere fact that you might even think that Islam is not what it claims to be (The religion of peace) opens you to their vitreous attacks.  They make complex issues out of what is really quite simple.  Would you accept the doctrine of a warlord-pedophile who talks to angels, believes that he has the final word of god, wants to kill atheists, homosexuals and anyone who either leaves or turns their back on Islam?  If the answer is no then you don't have to like or accept Islam.",

Trump won the election (fair and square) and is still very popular among his supporters, so get over it. Americans (not Canadians) can vote someone else in, in 4 years, if they don't like him. Maybe some of the lefty protesters will actually be motivated to vote by then. But there is no doubt Trump is working very hard on his agenda, and you can't fault him for that.",

For the Globe and Mail to attempt to equate the use of the word master as skillful being the same as a slave owner is plain idiotic.  I am not offended by the title of Master for Massey College -- I am deeply offended by the use of the word master as a slave owner, as Marrus did.  This is essentially the same situation as the the fellow from Ontario who's name is Grabher, and who had his personal license plate cancelled because someone found it offensive.  There is a difference between \"Grabher\" and \"Grab her\", and Master and master.  Unfortunately for Prof. Marrus, he found humour in expressing a derogatory comment to a minority who he should have known would find it offensive, just as he would find any derogatory Jewish term aimed at him.

A wound inflicted upon one member of our community is a wound inflicted upon us all.\" (CNN- Either Trump doesn't understand what he's saying or he's lying.)\n\n3. \"I didn't say I love you because you're black, or I love you because you're white, or I love you because you're from Japan, or you're from China, or you're from Kenya, or you're from Scotland or Sweden. I love all the people of our country.\" (CNN- He mentioned Kenya. Outrageous!)\n\nTrump is correct. The media is biased against him.",

The offered a star who wanted to be in Toronto a deal they knew he'd reject (he was days from agency, of course he'd decline it) with a strict timeline.  They then moved on much too quickly in order to sign Morales for too much term in a market that was over stuffed with DH-types.  There's no positive way to spin it for the Jays.  They screwed this up.\n\n- Edwin's agent really screwed this up.  Yes, it is possible for both sides to be in the wrong here.  Edwin wound up taking a deal that was inferior to the one the Jays initially offered.  Edwin was looking for 5/$125, and its clear that deal wasn't out there for him.  His agent misread the market, and Edwin had to settle for less guaranteed money.\n\n- The Jays will be worse on opening day in 2017 than they were on opening day in 2016.  They won't be younger, they won't be more athletic, they will have worse players.  I don't think you can argue any of that.",

During Castro's time in power, particularly during the 1960s to 1990s, Cuba was a far better place to live than almost anywhere else in Central America. Places like El Salvador, Nicaragua, and Guatemala were in the middle of vicious civll wars and genocides, driven by American-backed forces. 80,000 people were killed in ES; 80,000 in two wars in Nicaragua; in Guatemala, a genocide against the native population killed more than 200,000. Castro was certainly a dictator and he certainly did things wrong; but he cannot compare to the far worse monsters around him. Fighting the Cold War decades after it is over -and during the failure of capitalism - is ludicrous. I suggest that the Globe editorial writers think more before they write.",

There would not be environmental contamination of oocysts if cats weren't there to shed them.  Recent research indicates that cats can become reinfected and go through add'l oocyst shedding cycles.  The oocysts are very durable and can remain viable in soil or water for 18 months or more.  In dry conditions they can become aerosolized and inhaled.

Given  the fractious history of the federal and provincial/territorial governments trying to work together, most people would have said it couldn't be done. (In fact our previous PM claimed it was so impossible to work with the provinces, he simply avoided meeting with them altogether in tecent years and sent out decrees by note, instead - and who could blame him?). We have been fortunate to find now an incredibly talented politician. If he can handle the provinces, I am sure even Trump will not daunt him.",

Those would all be rational, reasonable objections. However if instead they were against it because they thought that cheese and beef should never touch, or because hamburgers will turn their kids into zombies, or because this is the first step in the annexation of Japan by California; then their objections would be unfounded, ridiculous, and based on fear and ignorance.

The principle of religious freedom means a lot to me, as it's one of the hallmarks of the enlightenment and liberal values, and it really pains me to see so many people who call themselves \"progressive\" appear so willing to hem that in. I can see it for some issues, like housing discrimination, but cakes? As for your other point, obviously a government official must do her job. If she can't, she should resign.

But with the coming of Mike Harris, that choice left as the Conservatives seemed to welcome and promote bigotry against any and all who were non-white and non-Christian.  Now there is no choice.  I have no choice but to choose the lesser evil Liberals because they don't attract all the anti-muslim, anti-semitic, anti-Aboriginal, anti-black hordes that the Cons do -and support.  One can see the Conservative party working hard to become a bastion of white nationalism, and as Macdougall rightly points out, refuses to see any non-white subset of the Canadian milieu in a positive light.  Until the white nationalist riff-raff is tossed from the party, the rest of us will remain with only one, real choice to govern.",

Entertainment/Club District, still has it's problems, with a recent unprovoked shooting right on the sidewalk.

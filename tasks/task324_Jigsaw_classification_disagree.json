First, no one cares about what Trudeau said about Castro, outside of a few rabid conservatives and the various leadership candidates of the CPC who think they can appeal to that rabid base. The really interesting question here is why these people are so lost in the past that they are fighting and evoking tropes from the Cold War. Don't they know that is over? Second, discussing Castro outside of the historical context is ludicrous. Castro is controversial precisely because he did  a lot of good along with the bad. As far as Latin American dictators go, Castro was one of the better ones  - a man who really did improve life for the great majority of his country's citizens, even as he resisted brutal American oppression. Through the 1960-1980s, Cuba was one of the best places in the region to live - much better than the American-backed vicious right wing dictatorships that slaughtered  their own people. That is what the rest of the world -and Trudeau -remembers.",

It was a criminal regime, being fleeced by other criminals, often to the advantage of American gangsters. During Castro's time in power, particularly during the 1960s to 1990s, Cuba was a far better place to live than almost anywhere else in Central America. Places like El Salvador, Nicaragua, and Guatemala were in the middle of vicious civll wars and genocides, driven by American-backed forces. 80,000 people were killed in ES; 80,000 in two wars in Nicaragua; in Guatemala, a genocide against the native population killed more than 200,000. Castro was certainly a dictator and he certainly did things wrong; but he cannot compare to the far worse monsters around him. Fighting the Cold War decades after it is over -and during the failure of capitalism - is ludicrous. I suggest that the Globe editorial writers think more before they write.",

I have no choice but to choose the lesser evil Liberals because they don't attract all the anti-muslim, anti-semitic, anti-Aboriginal, anti-black hordes that the Cons do -and support.

This means that homosexually inclined priests are more likely to abuse children. This is not the same as saying that in general, homosexuals are more likely to be child abusers.\nIt seems to me that for homosexuals, becoming  a Catholic priest opens up opportunities to encounter teenage boys or before this scandal, did in the recent past, hardly a calling from God and thus justifying the ban.\nAny priest with homosexual inclinations who has remained celibate and not communicated his sexual preferences to all and sundry need not feel insulted in the slightest.

What an utter moron who even at the end of the conference continued to harangue the president elect as he left the podium.  When reporters are the news, make the news, comment with each other about commentaries something is wrong with the entire system.  Being told you are rude which he was, to be quiet which he didn't and allow another reporter to speak all the while saying his network is attacked by Trump is a CNN new low.  Only the Globe & Mail support of this type of behaviour is more pathetic.  Obviously Chuck Todd of NBC saying you should start speaking to the average American instead of each other is lost on the press totally.",

Inflation increased people taxes due to the progressive (aptly named) tax system while their real income stayed the same reducing their spendable income further stifling growth. The 1990's and the massive expansion in our economy naturally increased tax revenue and gave Clinton the first balanced budget which of course Democrats and Rhino's quickly overcame. JFK first used voodoo economics to overcome his first 2 years of economic chaos so I guess you are denigrating him, correct?

What is being talked about is needed, but in addition, the flow of water was supposed to have an inlet/outlet at the Kapahulu groin so that the canal would actually have movement with the tides.  However, because Waikiki is the tourist mecca that it is, it's doubtful this connection would ever happen as it would probably make the Kapahulu end more like the Ala Moana end.  Run off from the mountains is inevitable.  Silt, mud and debris need to be dredged regularly to keep the canal deep enough particularly where Manoa stream empties into it.

In the U.S. we have been drawing these lines in state legislatures and finding some acceptance of restrictions starting at (I think) 20 weeks.  We need to deal with abortions afterward that protect the life of a woman and abortions in case of fetal abnormality.

Not only does the Crown have to prove the sex per se, but they also have to show that it was without consent.  This is so very difficult.  Further lost in the debate, is an accused willingness to fight such a charge.  No person - hardened criminal or regular joe - wants the tag of being a sex offender.

And how can you blame anyone for it?\n\nThe draft shouldn't even exist in the first place; calling some politician a \"draft dodger\" is the single most meaningless and hypocritical accusation one can make. Not to mention that Trump actually went to the military academy at least, for whatever that's worth. Is serving in Vietnam now somehow a prerequisite for anyone over 60 who wants to be president? Kind of stupid if you ask me.",

Men are more quickly aroused and also, as a group, give each other facile permission to act on that arousal--and this has been true for thousands of years.   Men don't get pregnant, carry a baby for nine months and form a bond to their babies even before birth.  And this is especially true if a man isn't in a loving, committed relationship.  \nThe question is--why haven't our religious/moral leaders--bishops in this case--never held laymen accountable?

Yes, there are scientific uncertainties re: the details and pace of impacts -- e.g. how fast we will lose Arctic sea ice; exactly when, where, and how severe will be the next floods or droughts; how fast will sea levels rise; etc.  But there is virtually no uncertainty regarding the fact that climate change impacts will generally be catastrophic, and the only rational policy approach is to drastically reduce global carbon emissions, livestock grazing, and deforestation.

Your math is wrong: shutting down contraception alone would add about 200K abortions for a total of 521K abortions annually. Shutting down both would do nothing to reduce demand, it would add 521K abortion demand to other clinics including back-alley abortions ending in death through septicemia, a hideous death.

This is a classic example of how land is privatized once it is removed from federal domain.\n\nThe state started with 3.4 million acres of school land bequeathed by the Feds and has now sold it down to less than 700 thousand acres. Much of this land was sold even cheaper than the Elliott is being sold for... about 30 cents on the dollar of real value.\n\nThe K12 PERS fund will probably be a winner in this sale.

With tens of thousands of Korean and Chinese women reportedly being forced to be sex slaves, you would think that at least one of them would have come forward to make the allegation immediately after the war, yet none did.   It was not until the 1992, about 47 years after the war ended, that a researcher reported about the Japanese military operating brothels for its soldiers staffed with \u201ccomfort women\u201d or \u201csex slaves\u201d from the occupied territories.

Remember you are coming to our home......respect our values  and learn to live within our rules and values.....or leave!!   Its simple.  We cant take a boble to their countrirs, but they can come here and try to change our country into a form of their own.  Ridiculous! 8m so impressed with Quebec taking the initiative to stop them from taking our country and turning it into a circus show!!!!  Quebec......Alberta is rite with u on this!!!!\nCheers        jay from Grande Prairie",

Gil Gustafson's engaging confession certainly attempts to lead us down that path, but do we really need to go there?  Our own petty cravings: the sweets that rot our teeth, the fatty morsels that pork us out, the disgusting movies & books that taint our minds do damage to our own bodies and souls; but the cravings of  people like Gustafson do unspeakable harm to others.  They prey upon and rob sweet children of their innocence killing their  budding spirits; children who might have been destined for greatness had the spotlight been put upon their stalkers before the unmentionable happened.

I attend an Episcopal church now with many gendered priests. Yet sometimes I would like a pope who is a little infallible, since some Episcopal churches can change essentials too easily. BTW, Buddhists teach that their doctrine, even considered to be  a rather mobile skillful means, is indefectibe, i.e., cannot be overturned. We do long for some certitude, but that is better realized when the entire church functions in the presence of Christ. Which I take to mean acting in awareness of the indwelling Spirit of Christ.",

Period. These matters do not affect you, so please stop commenting on things you do not understand - it's ignorant. \n\n3) Your worries about 'the children' & 'dangerous roads' are red herrings. Consumption patterns of cannabis only marginally change over the long-term after legalization. Which means cannabis consumption, and these potential problems, are already here.   I was encouraged to see the TF address that reality clearly.\n\n4) The TF has to balance these realities with the reality that outright prohibition does not work.

If I didn;t know know you speak from ignorance --- and are therefore unaware of what I just said --- it would make me wonder what kind of company you keep.  Frankly, my friend, you seem not to argue in good faith,  Yes, you argue softly, with a calm voice.  But you have a penchant for never conceding a point, even when it's obvious.  Either that or simply saying, \"Let's move on,\" when it's clear that for you to say more would result in a concession, were you to continue in good faith.  For example, with respect to the Espionage Act, your contention that \"gross neg\" does not include \"extreme neg.\"",

The sex assigned at birth is most often based on visible genetalia, which can sometimes be ambiguous or misleading, and can only be truly confirmed through a genetic test.  Gender is the self-perception that is formed by a person to identify as male, female or somewhere in-between; it is on a continuum and is not necessarily static. A new-born can't really be deemed to have a gender since they don't yet have any perception of male or female.  Since gender is on a continuum and can change, there is no point in having gender on identity documents in the first place.

What you are saying is that \"country folk\" should have more of a say in presidential elections than \"city folk\" or \"suburban folk\".  You also seem to feel that all rural voters are monolithically conservative and all urban ones are liberal, which is not accurate.  It is you who are dividing people into categories.  Eliminating the Electoral College would be fine too but much less likely to happen.  By either method one gets to the same end.

They did not \"storm\" PSE's HQ then but rather stood outside singing, drumming, praying, and leading a discussion about respecting Mother Earth. Later, they gave peaceful, respectful public comment during the Bellevue city council meeting. Unfortunately, our \"mayor\", John Stokes, was caught on audio calling them (and CENSE, the organization they were at council to support) \"shameless\". \"Mayor\" Stokes later issued a non-apology apology, which the Bellevue Reporter printed.\n\nLet's stick to facts.",

My experience is the same as many others here, which is that gay couples and gay parents remain and will remain a statistical minority (by far). There are places in the country where those families are more common because, like most families, gay families choose when they are able to live where they are welcome, safe and where the culture includes them and their children. So it can seem in certain parts of the country that, everywhere you look, you see gay families which means you see \"fewer\" straight families. But it just isn't the overall statistical truth. Additionally, gay parents mostly raise straight children because straight (heterosexual) is the statistical norm and so \"gay parents\" are, in most families, a one generation phenomenon and then that family goes back to the statistically normal pattern: straights parents, straight kids.",

Let's erase the chalkboard and go back to square one.  Consumers were yelling and screaming about mistreatment by debt collectors in the 1970s.  Phone calls at all hours of the night.  Repeated calls to employers, neighbors, friends, relatives.  The tone of voice, language used by collectors were over the top.  In 1977, in response to the demands of consumers, the Congress passed the law.  The issue I am addressing is the collector of the debt, not the debt itself.  I am saying that it does not matter if the debt is sold five times, if the collector is abusive, then the law has been violated.  What the Court is doing here is given shelter and comfort to businesses buying debt instruments, thus avoiding the intent of the law itself.  Get it?  Got it?  Good.",

How many of us used outside toilets in Minnesota in the winter  and actually used old Sears catalogs with their slick pages? You can't keep crying wolf every time you want something. Also,I was thinking yesterday about these villages wanting liqueur stores and the voting that goes on for them. It's not a state election or presidential election why not tell the little kids and young girls about the product of what booze brings into the villages and let them vote too, they're the ones that will suffer. When dad or uncle comes home stinking drunk and first you lose all respect at even seeing them and smelling the stink and then you have to deal with the results it's sad. Or when brother plays with guns. The people in the villages know where the illegal booze comes from and who makes it but they do nothing, what will change when it's legal, more money to fight the effects, sick, sick.",

Whatever drawbacks Hillary had as a candidate, those pale in comparison to Trump who is a dangerous demagogue who has inspired violent white supremacists to violence and has attempted to legitimize white supremacy and the disregard of democratic institutions. \nThis is why he disingenuously told Americans \"don't be afraid,\" because he knows Americans are afraid of him and his destructive and violent agenda.
